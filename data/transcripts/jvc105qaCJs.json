  "full_text": "welcome to lesson seven folks of the short-term trading module for ICT mentorship this teaching is dealing with intra-week reversals and overlapping models okay obviously in every one of our teachings we have to remind you that we're working with time and price and one of the questions I want to lead in this teaching with is obviously I've shared with you specific weekly profiles and when I was teaching for free I taught that there were Market reversal profiles intra week and Inter day and we'll talk about intraday when we get into day trading but for short-term trading there's intra-week Market reversal profiles that for the uninitiated or the uninformed there are many times caught off guard by the likelihood of a potential reversal and early on in my career I had these events as well and it plagued me it was one of those things that just kept coming up all the time I'd have a trade it was profitable it would be working for me and then something would happen midweek and it would completely reverse and I would hope and pray that it would get back in sync with what I was expecting to see as a long-term trade and it didn't happen it came back and rolled right up against me and either stopped me out or pressured me so much that I had to get out of the trade if you've never experienced this you will eventually so it's important we cover it now one of the hardest things for me to teach when it comes to Market profiling is the market reversal profile because I have to teach not just one element of trading or discipline of trading but I have to teach a multiple approach either swing trading short-term trading day trading or position trading swing trading and short-term trading something to that effect so it can't be understood as efficiently as it would be as if the student or the trader was well versed in more than one trading discipline so when I was teaching on the forums years ago and I was sharing my information on YouTube and on my own website uh the problem I was well aware of but I wanted to kind of like lay some foundations to the folks that were really involved in learning and studying they could have not get to the what I'm going to share here but you know come to the conclusion that there are certain guidelines and approaches that leads to a potential intra-week Market reversal profile and we're going to cover the components that leads to that in this teaching here okay in our example again we're going to be using the British pound and this time by having RPD arrays again okay I want you to focus on this low right here this actually happened the week of this recording and it created what we're going to be talking about in this teaching I was kind of waiting for this uh week to close anyway so I can actually use this as an example but if you go through the notes in this teaching you'll be able to go back over historical data and see where they manifest themselves and the criteria I teach in this lesson you'll see that a just like script it follows it almost to the to the letter so what we're looking at is the low that was formed on cable and the intra-week reversal and what led up to that and what are the characteristics that generally are a part of this phenomena first we have to identify the fact that the market was in a premium Market classified by the large trading range that we talked about and outlined in lesson five so we're in the premium range of the pdra Matrix and perhaps you saw that the market was trading up into the weekly rejection block or traded up into Old bearish order block on The Daily charts therefore we could potentially see the market trade lower as we were anticipating potentially seeing this week but it trades down into a lower level PD array in the discount it doesn't do it over the course of the entire week no no it does this in a matter of 24 hours so as the market in this case the cable British pound USD trades over 200 points in a period of 24 hours the market reaches for a level with speed for a particular reason and when you look at the daily chart here we've outlined the PD arrays and you can see that there's a daily bullish order block mean threshold and price reaches right into that on Wednesday of the week of this recording when we see a fast Market we have to immediately assume that they're reaching for a level institutional order flow that is highly critical for efficiency on the interbank level now that may be in the form of Commerce globally or it could be in the form of a repricing at the Central Bank level either one of those could happen rather quickly and while it took some time to gradually drift down over the 24-hour time period for that whole entire range to form between Tuesday going into Wednesday's low the idea is you're going to anticipate at the beginning of the week a certain outcome and it's prudent that you stick to that okay because over the course of a career you're going to get caught in a reversal like this once in a while it's not going to plague your career obviously after learning what's being taught in this lesson but you also have a checklist on things that may lead to that type of scenario and if you go back over to the Chart index and look at some of the examples we were talking about as it relates to the cable there were telltale signs and I gave you a little marker telling you that there's a potential area of Bounce likely in this pair what led me to that are the things that I'm going to teach you in this lesson because I understand multiple dimensions of trading whether it be position trading short-term trading swing trading day trading scalping all that business I am versed in understanding and reading price universally it's not one type of time frame to me that makes sense it's all the time frames I know how to blend them together that part comes with experience and after a measurable growth in your experience and working within different disciplines of trading this is the reason why I tell you regardless of whatever you think you want to be at the beginning of the mentorship it's going to graduate into other things but I'm forcing you across all of them if you're willing to submit to all of them and stay with the mentorship again it's not a plug you decide whether you're staying here or not but by having a well-versed approach and understanding across all the disciplines you inherently have a advantage over those individuals that just stick to just one format or discipline or trading I'm a scalper I'm only going to worry about scalping okay well then you're not going to be that good at scalping because you have a limited myopic view on price action so having a well-rounded approach to price action what multiple time frames different disciplines you will by default be a better Trader at whatever discipline you focus on as a career so we're going to look at this little range in here that's not so much of a little range but we're gonna look at the move in this particular decline down into the daily bullish order block mean threshold and what what the Catalyst that led to that reversal first thing you want to notice is that price is unwilling to leave the premium so we're in the upper portion of the larger trading range defined by in lesson five so while we saw initially in the beginning of the week the market want to decline and it was doing it aggressively and speedily if you will by seeing that we could have if we didn't understand PD array Matrix discount arrays we could have easily expected this Market to keep on trading lower maybe even going down to the fair value Gap or if you're a classic support resistance person maybe just that old low made back in January myopic I know but nonetheless this View leads to what many times breaks accounts and careers it dashes the hopes of would-be Traders because they aren't informed you're learning the mechanics of how price is delivered we're going to look at this range here and Define it in a context that would otherwise not be available to you so we'll look at the first two days of the week going into Wednesday's low and I want you to understand just how much that price range is it's extraordinary it look at the the length of that candle for the most part it's many times larger than the general average of all the candles here now obviously there's a few of them here that are larger but in general terms the candles slightly before and the candles to the right of it that large down candle on Tuesday it's pretty much a dominating candle so it was speed at which it moved in one trading day to get down to a specific institutional order flow reference point we're going to take a closer look at this and we're going to look at a four hour chart and we're going to refine it and give it a little bit more detail the yellow area is that same range defined across the entire week from when these rallied Tuesday's decline in the Wednesday's low and price returns to a discount pdra reversing enter week now we we can see it clearly here it's hindsight it's perfect it's 2020. we can see it but we have to go into it with the details because that's what's going to help you see what it looks like going forward why did we anticipate a bounce there why did I give it to you in your chart Index this week the things I'm going to show you here I want you to take a look at the low here and it forms on Wednesdays Market low and it's trading at a daily bullish order block mean threshold after the bounce at the daily bullish order block mean threshold ipta draws price up into a four hour bearish order block premium PD array notice the efficiency how it trades right up into it it's exactly right to The Logical area where price should reach for if it's going to a premium Market there's very little movement below the level that's identified as the daily bullish order block mean threshold and it trades right to the four hour bearish order block you can't get any better than that in terms of price delivery clearly seen with the four hour order block traded here so now we're going to take it and refine it down to an hourly chart and give it a lot more flesh on the skeleton we're outlining as a market reversal profile I want you to note the large decline from the first of the week now obviously I'm I'm beating this in your head because this is the classic Telltale sign that you have a potential Market reversal profile think about it every time that the market quickly starts trading on Monday or Tuesday aggressively and speedily that's usually a Telltale sign it's in a hurry to make a weekly range or it's going to go to an Institutional order flow reference point that could potentially cause it to reverse and go the other way so now we can see Monday starts as a potential high of the week profile rallies initially right from Sunday's opening declines a little bit and then we have another rally into the London session on Tuesday and it aggressively trades lower trading rate into the changeover from Tuesday into Wednesday creating the low of the week and then we have an aggressive move off that low this right here this price decline the speed at which and the magnitude of which it moves is The Telltale sign that's the characteristic that leads you to okay we're really moving quickly and we're covering a lot of ground in the beginning of the week whenever that happens you immediately start looking for higher time frame PD arrays that may cut cause or be a catalyst for intra-week Market reversal profile if you do not do this and you fall into the the thought process that okay it's moving quickly it's moving fast so therefore I'm going to make a lot more money in double time and it's probably going to have an equal leg you know lower later in the week in the same mood no don't think like that okay don't think like that at all speed in price is indicative of them getting to a valuation point when price is in a hurry to get somewhere think about when central banks reprice for instance when they do interest rate announcements okay there's very little time from where right before the announcement then the news comes out and then the the rate changes that is not attributed to buying and selling okay that's a repricing based at the Central Bank level it's a sudden thing and that's why there's such a wide disparity between where price is at one moment then all of a sudden it's somewhere else that repricing is a response to a central bank intervention or interest rate announcement when there is no Central Bank involvement and price is just aggressively and speedily moving okay that's based on evaluation through speculation so they're taking the market down through ipta in this case down to a daily premium to Discount range in other words it's moving away from a premium down into a discount PD array but we're still in the larger premium range so if you were just looking at price and you understood or what were sold this would look like it's probably going to keep going lower it's going to continue going lower but no the only thing it's doing is it's showing and willingness to get back down to a discount level okay think about how I showed you in the previous lesson how you can grade modular smaller ranges in terms of premium and discount arrays that same thing is being used here but just in scope of keeping it in the upper portion of the premium range on that daily chart that we've broken down in lesson five so while we're still overall in a premium Market longer term short term it can continuously move higher and keep making higher highs think about it like when you trade with bearish Divergence just because the momentum indicator is diverging barracy doesn't mean price is going to say okay well I'm going to turn around go the other way because the stochastics are macd it continuously can keep moving higher up that same element takes place when we're looking at just price action alone so while we are in a premium Market the market is showing a willingness to not here's the key not move out of a premium Market in other words why didn't this continuously go lower Wednesday into Thursday going into the discount Market because it needs to go higher it wants to go higher so if it's not going to go lower and it wants to go higher where do we focus we focus on premium PD arrays now Wednesday breaks a short-term high and then we start seeing evidences of institutional sponsorship on every bullish order block every order block that forms with the down candle or a series of Down Candles we extend it out in time you can see them capitalizing each one of them with new long positions and we're seeing a positive confirmation because prices quickly surging away from that level every instance we see new evidences of institutional sponsorship and up into a fair value Gap premium PD array now intra-week reversals will many times look to return to the previous balanced price range or exceeded now what does that mean think about the market maker cell and buy profiles okay or Market maker cell and buy models in this case here this could end up becoming a market maker by profile we have the consolidation known as in this example as the price balance range or it's price is in a small little range and then it leaves it on Tuesday aggressively sells off we have the smart money reversal into Tuesdays Wednesday overlap then we have a low risk Buy on Thursday then we have a continuation for reaccumulation on Friday but prices traded up into that price balance range all over again it's right back up and again so when we see that this could be the end of the move it can be this could all that's been necessary is for them to trade right back up that price balanced range but we always have to have the likelihood on our mind that price May exceed it and go past it which is what the market maker buy profile really aims to do it take out the liquidity above and on high in this case we have a lower high formed on Tuesday than Monday so it may not necessarily need to go above it but personally between you and I I think it will so here we have a British pound naked one-hour chart now if we were just given this example here in price action maybe some of us would be able to see that low down there and see some evidence to support why it should go up and then maybe not whenever we have a storyline or a potential outcome in the marketplace in our mind that we we formed an opinion we have a plan that we're going to try to execute on it's important that we we're mindful that the setup may not pan out for instance the beginning of this week you may have seen this as a potential high of the week and you expected to see Friday's close be lower than Wednesday's low guess what just like I do sometimes you're gonna get it wrong the evidences of the fact that the Market's moving quickly at the beginning of the week this is Monday and Tuesday Monday and Tuesday okay or one of the two if we see sudden quick movement in price and magnitude here's the key word here it's got to cover a lot of distance what's average uh average distance of the last few days if it exceeds it a lot whatever the average daily range is for the last five days if it gets well above it chances are you're probably going to see a market reversal profile it doesn't mean it always will happen it just means that start considering it okay I mentioned in the commentary through this week that we were probably going to see the weekly range form in one day and we did we pretty much ended up seeing that with the exception of a small little tail noted here on Monday's high uh the whole range for cable was really formed on Tuesday so that's indicative it's characteristic of a market reversal profile intra week so the main thing I want you to understand in this lesson is that at the beginning of the week we anticipate the higher low the form period that's that's a given that that's that's the nature of ICT Concepts because as humans were generally good starters and the week starts with the new hopes and aspirations to make money in exchange and commerce but opinions can change directives can be changed and the central bank and the banks themselves they can make policy changes and or fundamentals may change that we're not aware of and yes you heard that right I don't know what they are that causes price to change at the Central Bank level I don't need to know it I can see the evidences of it in price so when we move forward and going through price action study it's important that you understand that knowing the higher time frame PD arrays will Aid in failures that means when you have a trade that doesn't seem like it's working out for you even though you're profitable chances are it's probably better for you to get out of it and look for another entry point if it doesn't give you a strong entry point chances are it's probably going to be a market reversal profile Wednesday or Thursday reversals generally form every month so no matter what pair you're looking at there's generally some kind of a a reversal of sorts that can form so by going over examples and looking at Price hit you'll see many more examples in just this one here and everything we're showing is reversed when there's an intra week Market reversal profile that goes higher and then sells off so it's a generic concept it's very simple things that leads up to it the classic telltale signs are the magnitude at which the price moves on Monday and Tuesday okay so it's only two days you have to focus on how much is price moving on Monday and Tuesday so if you're seeing a lot of movement in your favor and it's really covering a lot of distance and it's doing it quickly many instances you're going to see it like this week really built in on one trading day when it does that consider the higher time frame PDA race because it's probably going down to evaluation or a higher level valuation point and then it's going to have a lot of sponsorship come in and then those flows are going to turn the market it's going to turn it the other way and if you fight that it can beat you up or dare I say it break your account now consider swing trading model overlap possibilities and we've talked about the likelihood of using short-term trading Concepts in one shot one kill and now we're going to blend or overlap trading models so it helps you kind of formulate a better understanding here we have that same area price action and what I've done was I've outlined it in terms of a premium and discount PD array Matrix so we can see in the green area that's the discount area and I have it graded as well with four grades or four quadrants and the premium area is posted and it's divided as well notice that on the daily chart we have a daily bullish order Block it's trading down into that so if we look at this model here think about what I taught you in the swing trading model this is a swing trade entry this is exactly what you look for for a swing trade now if you're not a swing Trader if you don't think like a swing Trader then you're not going to see this as a swing trade entry you're not going to see it as a potential setup that could many times pay out much more than what a one shot one kill would if you're only focusing on I'm going to be a short-term Trader or I'm going to only be a day trader I'm only going to be a scalper these types of setups will evade you and by evading you it's also going to become a pitfall for you you're not going to know when there's going to be these potential reversals they'll get you'll get caught off guard so now we're going to take that same element everything we saw in the daily chart that is just applied we're just re viewing it from a one-hour standpoint so we can see the intraday price action on a day by day division you can see here reversals intra week they occur here's the secret they occur in overlapping models every Market reversal that happens enter week will be a overlapping of two types of trading disciplines they'll be at odds with one another here's the rub the higher time frame discipline will always win that's why we have to focus on monthly weekly and daily PD arrays that's why I beat it in your head that they are the most important ones anything less than that four hour that's about as low as you want to go anything less than that is all day trading stuff and if their day trading things are not in alignment with a higher time frame daily weekly or monthly no less than a four hour you're really not trading high probability setups so it's important that you understand that the reversals are not always going to surprise you now because you have some characteristics to look for and now by having an opinion of not just one shot one kill short-term trading or swing trading but you have position trading as well and by blending all those elements together it gives you a greater understanding about price action and now because you have these characteristics in each discipline understood when you see a opposing view if a swing Trader's approach saying it's a buy when you're looking at a One-Shot one kill sell-off chances are your weekly range phenomenon that you're trying to trade is going to have opposition to the degree where it will cause a reversal as it's being shown here so daily Swing model overlap example shown here will hopefully ground you in your understanding about how intra-week Market reversals occur takeaways from this lesson again are the speed at which price moves on Monday and Tuesday the magnitude at which it moves there's your number one characteristic Telltale sign you're probably going to see a market reversal and your week and look for overlapping opposing trading models if one is suggesting a Buy on a higher time frame while in a lower time frame it's looking like it may continue going lower the arm wrestling match is always going to be won by the higher time frame so hopefully you've learned something that brings you closer to a greater understanding of price action and intra-week reversals and blending and overlapping trading models",
