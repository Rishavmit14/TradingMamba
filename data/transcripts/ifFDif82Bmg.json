  "full_text": "welcome back folks this is the ict optimal trade entry pattern recognition series volume number eight in a series of 20 videos and today's episode is going to be featuring the british pound cable all right so we already have our chart set to the five minute time frame all right so we're going to put some lipstick on this and the reason why i'm going through it a little bit quicker than normal is i'm going to show you a playback of a trade actually that's being shown here friday here's friday's high and this is sunday's trading so if we're trading on monday disregard sunday consider friday okay friday's higher friday's low new york session 8 30 a.m right there all the way to 11 a.m new york time and i'm going to zoom in to this little area right in here all right so here's our five minute chart and we're zoomed into monday may 18 2020 and again new york session area where we highlight specific setups for this model and for some of you that are actually familiar with this channel it's not the ict new york kill zone uh we're actually giving you a wide 8 30 a.m to 11 a.m which takes us up into a little bit towards the midpoint of london close and the heart of new york open so it's kind of like a kill zone in itself but not the one everyone's familiar with so i created this model just to share with the public so that way you guys can avoid having to pay anybody okay you don't have to pay for any education you don't have to join all these chat rooms you ain't got to pay for these signal services that's why i did this because i want to put those people out of business i've already made my money but they're all scratching the bottom of the barrel trying to get people to do something that they can't even make money with so i'm proving it because i'm giving it to you for free and it didn't work it wouldn't be shown to you here every single day now i've received a lot of flack already and i've expected that as well folks saying well these are only just hindsight examples anybody can see this stuff after the fact and that's all you ever do ict is hindsight and i want to just remind you all that hindsight is how everyone starts and this is a series basically to kind of inspire and motivate individuals because sometimes this industry can be rather daunting there's a lot of things that are dangled in front of you but they're mainly fluff just about everyone i've seen on social media especially instagram are all frauds none of them make money not with trading okay and i'm proving that i can not only do it myself but i can also transfer that information to someone else and they can do the same thing so with that spirit in mind that's why i've done this video series is to show you how a setup that is worked with very specific rule-based ideas around a specific time of day it happens every single day monday through friday you can't ask for anything better than that alright so looking at friday's chart high that's what this line is up here and we're going to look at the optimal trade entry right here all right so we're going to take our fib and draw it from this kilo here what makes this a kilo i'll tell you in a second so there's our fib and we're going to extend this out in time and again i apologize i want to keep these videos really really short but it's just gonna be a little bit more impactful if i show you the business all right so here's the swing low here's our swing high the retracement down into optimal trade entry right in here and you can see how price made a run above now look very carefully did it get to half of the standard deviation that makes up the fib range okay this is our dealing range the projection never even got to 0.50 you don't need it to remember the fib is just a ballpark figure markets don't move on fibs okay that's not what it is the fibonacci okay just helps me frame an idea that is very visual to a new trader okay there's other things that's going on inside this swing that i don't really require this fibonacci and most of my students in the mentorship don't require this fibonacci either but for a late audience people that are just warming up to me and people that just simply want to come back and watch more ict videos know that i use the fib just to help frame the idea it doesn't need the fib you don't need it but it helps give the foundation to a trader that can't really see key price swings in a trend or a fractal of price action all right so with that said you see price comes down hits the optimal trade entry and i actually entered right on this candle okay now i did this for a particular reason it's not important for you to get actually right inside that optimal trade entry you don't need to get that now it's better if you can but sometimes you're going to sit down in front of the charts and this is what happened today i was talking to my son and i'm trying to get him going in terms of learning how to do this on his own as well and i sat down in front of the british pound as i was talking to him i said okay right now it's forming right now and i went in real quick open up trading view and i did a trade and and entered it and did the whole thing so the idea is that it was going to run this short term high but using the parameters for this model that i've made for youtube reaching for an old high which is monday reaching to friday's high and again this is friday's high price reaches up into it and the whole business is running above these relative equal highs this high and this high so there's going to be liquidity above that all right so yes this is the pattern and yes this is what it looks like in hindsight and yes you can see the candles i entered on and the candle i exited on so you can actually see a recording of this trade and it's seen here and i'll just let it play out real quick and then we'll finish this video so you can see the entry is there stop was at 21.68 and i'm saying there's going to be a sudden expansion higher and again i'm showing you that it's a live data port from trading view i had many people over the years asked me to go on trading view and i've done that i've abandoned mt4 because it's proven that it can be faked and it's fraud and here i am giving more of my commentary and again drawing your focus up to those relative equal highs there's an order block that could be tapped but it's not necessary in other words i'm allowing for it to go that low and it would not change the trade and it runs up and expands above that high and it just repeats and loops over on twitter so you can see that if you're a member of my twitter feed and i've mentioned once in a while if i feel inspired to do so i'll draw your attention to something that has my eye it doesn't mean i'm giving you an entry it doesn't mean i'm giving you a stop and a target i just draw everyone's attention to a specific market and if you're familiar with my concepts and if now if you're a student of this particular video series then you'll know what i might be hinting at and i don't play the both directions in whichever one pays out i'm right there i'm one side and either i'm right or i'm wrong and i'll leave that for you to decide over long-term consistency",
