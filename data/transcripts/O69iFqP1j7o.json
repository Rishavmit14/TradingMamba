  "full_text": "welcome to the ICT mentorship short-term trading lesson number six we're teaching low resistance liquidity runs in trending conditions okay much like we mentioned in the low resistance liquidity runs in consolidations the same thing applies obviously in training conditions because we understand that the market moves from a time and price Theory for looking back 20 40 and 60 trading days for if the data ranges and referencing time and for one shot one kill or short-term trading we focus primarily in the last three months for the most Salient institutional reference points we key off of obviously the PD arrays based on a premium or discount Market and we're looking to trade from one PD array to the next ideally from a discount to a premium range that can be easily defined okay for our case study for liquidity runs and training conditions we're going to be looking at the pound again and this time we're going to be looking at a different fractal of the larger consolidation so we're going to be looking at a smaller segment of this price action and because price is universally fractal what could be a consolidation on one time frame can be a trending environment in another so we're going to add our PD arrays from the monthly weekly daily and we're going to use this information in conjunction with the trending environment conditions that we use to trade from a low end discount to a high-end premium Market in other words we're going to be looking at an example of buying during a upswing or a trending bull market our case studies going to be focusing on this price lag here as identified in the Shaded area and this is going to be our trending condition now before we get into it notice that we are originating the basis of that swing up from a deep discount Market overall the larger consolidation we can see clearly that the market has found support and because we're in a discount Market the market generally is going to want to move to a premium either by a short-term basis or any turn basis or a long-term basis so since we're looking for short-term trades we know that predominantly the market in the March time period is in a oversold condition in oversold condition or defined as we refer to it as a discount market so the market is going to want to reach up into some measure of a premium if there's a displacement and the market trades higher we'll know that because the market is showing a aggressive nature to trade higher and if that is being shown in price then we know that institutions are funneling money and they're also building positions in that up move now obviously if they are building long positions and the market is accelerating on the upside they're reaching for some institutional reference point where they can unload that long position at a profitable point they have to find willing buyers at a higher level so we have to look for premium PD arrays where willing participants in the marketplace will want to buy from a lower holding long holder or in this case smart money okay for one shot one kill uh we're gonna be dealing specifically with the four hour chart now the four hour chart is in my opinion the easiest Trading time frame for one shot one kill setups or how to frame that's set up uh because it's my cup of tea if you will it's my forte my my go-to trading model um I have learned that the four hour chart can give us all the insights that's necessary for using all the details and and components to finding one shot one kill or short-term trading with high probability trading conditions so by using a four hour chart it's easier to frame a One-Shot one kill or short-term trade in this time frame because you can see with a simple couple clicks of your mt4 platform and if your platform doesn't use this whatever the equivalent would be but if you hold down control and touch the letter Y it'll give you the date dividers okay and specifically when you're in four hour it's not giving you the daily dividers it's actually giving you the weekly dividers so every vertical dotted line here represents the beginning and end of a new trading week when we look at Price like this and we have the PD arrays on our chart it's very easy to see where price will reach up to notice that we're also looking at this pair with the gradients shown across all of the discount and premium ranges so we not only have the discount premium range divided then we have the upper portion divided and then we have those smaller divisions in half as well so we can see how the market has different levels of progressive premium and Progressive discount levels in other words lower levels of discount and higher levels of Premium when we look at the four hour chart and we can see a PD array for instance a discount PD array this could be in the form of a bullish order block an old low a fair value Gap a breaker any of these types of PD arrays if we're looking to go long if that occurs or forms near a divider level or a quadrant level as I call it you'll be able to see high probability movement away from that level and then reach for an opposing level for instance if we look at the market in March 15th where price had come down into the fair value Gap it also trades back to a breaker seen here that move trading to that level gives us an ideal scenario to get along we may have missed the entry at a lower level but we can see this return to a breaker or fair value and Market explodes on the upside And Trades higher you don't need the absolute low in a bullish weekly close or up weekly range to be a One-Shot one kill you just need one setup that you wait for that makes logical sense that gives you a realistic pip objective and I think realistically uh for starters you should be looking for 30 to 50 Pips a week those types of scenarios and then graduate into 50 to 75 and then 75 to 100 Pips per week I wouldn't try to go more than 100 Pips and I like to live in a 50 to 75 pit range myself personally but you do to suit yourself I just know that you're not always going to get big weekly ranges sometimes you'll get small weekly ranges and it's going to be harder for you to get that 100 pit range if it only moves about 150 Pips for the week so you're going to really Define a perfect entry and exit strategy to get that I'm not saying it can't be done folks but you know just give yourself some flexibility on both ends getting in and getting out and so if you're looking for the lines portion of the weekly range you know taking a portion of that is all that's necessary for your career so if you look at the four hour chart what we're doing is we're encapsulating the weekly range and you can see this is the entire weekly range for this particular week shaded in yellow you can also see that the market reaches up into logical areas of Premium PD arrays and we'll cover that in a few moments but look at this for a second and think about the power three that I teach where if the Market's bullish the open will be near the low or the range and the close will be near the high of the range you can see that here the market has a initial move lower in the beginning of the week makes the low of the week and then it explodes on the upside it gives a few not many a few high probability entry points if you missed a very low point it's not a problem look at the four hour chart with all of the monthly weekly daily PD arrays obviously in the four hour to keep this chart clean I didn't add the four hour PD arrays you can add them and you'll have more detail on this chart and you'll have more insights to trade off of but to keep things germane and only on the higher time frame we're just using the PD arrays from the monthly weekly and daily levels and the subsequent week is seen here same scenario the market trades down initially making the low of the week and look at the response off of the divider between the total macro consolidation that we did and we discussed in the beginning of lesson number five for cable that removing that movement down into the the Midway point or equilibrium of the overall consolidation that is a high probability level in itself now if you don't understand how to break a range down or grade a range or Price swing you're going to miss these types of moves so you have to always look at the trading ranges that the Market's trading in look at the highest high and the lowest low in the form of the bodies not the Wicks and Define that and then once you have that that's like your master blueprint if you will and you start breaking that down because the algorithm is going to work within that range it's going to go back to reference points based on time and price where price is already traded where it hasn't been traded to in reference to time so we're looking for that same move that originated in March 14th uh going into the 15th that low formed in cable that was in a discount Market the second week that shaded in yellow here sees us reaching up into a halfway point of the upper portion of the total range or in other words half of the premium range that we defined by the daily chart in its larger trading range it moves from one level of logical discount to another level of logical premium it's very discernible you can clearly see it just by just grazing over this chart real quickly you're not going to get the benefit of looking at Price like this if you just if you don't study it basically and see the reactions how price is moving and gravitating towards how I've broken down the range they act like um magnets if you will there's a component to trading that people like to put on a truck I and I used to use I used to trade with it as well I used to trade with it as well they were called pivot Points and well they still are called private points to be honest but they came from the four Traders and and pit Traders where they would do calculations based on the high and the low and and adding specific uh measurements to get the projected highs and lows and supposed resistance now that was like a self-fulfilling prophecy but when you look at the the grades of a trading range or a price swing it helps you really discern where the market has its highest probable support or resistance without really having a logical old reference point like when we do support and resistance we look for an old level we draw it out in time and just because it did something back then we expected to do it again in the future and you've seen how that's worked out in your own trading it doesn't have any consistency so you have to look at what the institutions are doing and look behind the scenes and what's the institutional order flow so if we can grade A price swing from a premium or discount measure we can see the market was clearly in a discount range in the 14th of March so by trading down there trading into the fair value you got to shaded in green the natural response with BC price trade higher it does that and then it starts finding new levels of support institutionally based based on a discount PD array in other words we're looking for reasons to support price it could be in the form of a bullish order block fair value Gap a breaker a mitigation block it could be a old low or an old High once broken now turning support all those ideas okay lend well to supporting price going higher and you you start working towards a premium Market intra week the more we get closer to another level of Premium based on defining your range and defining your price swing and Grading it you know it's breaking it down into quadrants and then splitting in half when the market reaches for these measures okay it's almost like a mile marker for the algorithm it will reach for it and then give the participants at the bank opportunities to facilitate trade if it breaks through a level okay and it trades right through it you know that it's going to most likely reach for the next level up okay very rarely do you see any Midway points uh between the the grades that I've already given you here in or it's the way we Define the market breaking it down and cutting the the ranges in half the way we did that in lesson five that's the same levels we're seeing here so I didn't add anything new except for the shading of the yellow the box I'm just giving you the context behind the market and why it was doing what it was doing now clearly obviously one would say okay well this is obvious you know armchair quarterbacking it's a hindsight but if you go through the charts it's the same thing happening almost all the time so by having the theory behind why it's doing what it's doing we can look for how each week this same component or element to one shot one kill will repeat itself looking closer looking closer we can see that each week that the market we trade is going to seek to trade from one PD array to another it will trade from one quadrant to another with the least resistance it can move from premium to discount or discount to premium Market valuation now the determination of whether it's going to move higher or lower is based on where we're trading at at the time when you're sitting in front of the charts if we're in a premium Market it means we're really pushed up and we are into a logical area of where price has shown a willingness to sell off before it's away from its lowest levels of historical buys or where old lows have formed basically how we framed premium and discount Works we've already taught in this mentorship but when we have the levels on our chart and it's in a four hour basis it gives us context it tells us how we can anticipate the full weekly range because these daily or in this case you know four hours a weekly divider by hitting control and tapping y you get these vertical lines on mt4 what you'll end up doing is each week before the market starts trading on a Sunday and what you want to do is just load up your four hour chart have your PD arrays loaded on there and make notations on where you think price May logically reach up to when it's in a discount Market or where it may reach down to when it's in a premium Market by looking at where the PD arrays are in a four hour chart it's almost like you can anticipate what the weekly range will do in a completed sense in order to what the market looks like after the week closes on Friday and in a good example or exercise in this case would be to do this every single week try to anticipate what the weekly range will look like now you're not going to get this all the time it's not going to be perfect and many times you're not going to be close to it at all but what it will do is it will help build your anticipatory price skills which is necessary to start seeing this stuff before it happens we're trading in probabilities we're looking at a statistical Edge that the market if it's in a premium it's most likely going to want to trade lower where does it trade down to it's not just looking for a support level it's looking for an old area of institutional order flow where was their old buying where was their old institutional order flow seen in the marketplace and it's going to be in the form of a PD array so we look at our PD array Matrix to determine what are those PD arrays that exist in your chart at the time and you look at how reasonable it is for it to reach down into or up into that level between the two vertical lines you only have Monday through Friday well Sunday's opening until Friday so you have an element of time that you have to work within so because it's relatively short term in nature it's easy to predict where the market may go between a Monday and a Friday and you don't have to have the highest high and you don't have to have the lowest low you just need to know what's the probable Direction and what levels will it most likely key off of that's the benefit of using a four hour chart and using the PDA arrays from the monthly weekly and daily and four hour if you want to have all that on here but nonetheless if you key off a daily weekly and monthly PD arrays on a four hour chart you're going to get the highest probable trade reactions and that's where the institutions step in now when you refine it down to a lower time frame obviously in an hourly chart you get more detail you get more opportunities to you know reduce the risk and you might get another opportunity if you missed the overall daily or weekly PD array in other words if you missed that entry it may give you one more shot to get on it with an hourly chart but it's better if you just train yourself to work off of a four hour chart and start to Envision and kind of more or less predict what the weekly range is going to look like here's an example here where the market trades down into the fair value Gap we're in a deep discount Market and for that week it trades up into a bearish order block the subsequent week we have the price trading down into the equilibrium price point of the total macro range from the daily chart that we showed in lesson five and it also trades back down into an old bullish order block from the previous week and then the market trades up and closes in a fair value Gap seeing back in February now taking this information and refine it even further down into a 60 Minute chart you'll start to see a little bit more definition in the market and looking closely you'll see that there are many times you'll see Breakers and mitigation blocks that didn't exist on your four hour chart so anything less than a one hour chart when you're looking for one shot one kill really reduces the effectiveness because what you're looking for is that impulse price swing to help facilitate the weekly range or complete the weekly range anything less than a 60 Minute chart you're really just day trading or you're scalping so that's why you want to focus primarily on a four hour chart for the the levels you want to key off of but once you get down into an hourly chart then you can break the market down into a day by day basis and then we can start incorporating day of week phenomenon so if we're looking for a bullish Market moving from a discount Market to a premium each week what we're looking essentially for is the low of the week to form between Monday Tuesday and Wednesday they are the highest probable trading days in this environment so the criteria is in a trending environment we expect price to trade from a discount to a premium in this case we would reverse everything if we were expecting lower prices from a premium down to a discount Market but we have all our PD arrays on our chart and our levels and our quadrants on so we have all of our natural support resistance which is the grading of all of the levels that we did in lesson five and then incorporating the actual PD arrays in reference to the if the data range in the last 60 20 and 40 days the low of the week in bullish conditions in trending environments we look for the Monday Tuesday or Wednesday low to form in the first week we see here Monday Tuesday and Wednesday the low forms on Tuesday notice the low forms off of a logical PD array in a discount fashion trades down to a fair value Gap that's seen on the daily chart so price trades up creates a high that's slightly higher than Monday's high on Wednesday and then breaks through it and creates a higher high for the week so the intra week high is formed on Wednesday notice on Thursday it trades down into the fair value Gap into a mitigation block also from Wednesday's intradays trading and the market does what another impulse print price selling higher all the way into Thursday goes into consolidation and then Friday it has a small little Judas swing trades down into equilibrium and then expands on the upside going into the close the second week or subsequent week in our case study we see the low forms on Monday after it hits the equilibrium price point of the overall macro consolidation as we defined in lesson number five and then Tuesday we have a read trade back down into that same old low so we had another retouch of the equilibrium price point and then acceleration on the upside and then Wednesday we have another opportunity to get long trading off of a breaker that's formed on that week's Monday so we have Wednesdays trading trading down into a breaker uh a bullish breaker formed on Monday's high Wednesday's low is formed off of that trades higher and then notice also while we had slightly bullishness on Thursday and then a relatively flat close on that week's Friday um one of the things I want you to see is when we go through this com this process you're going to quickly learn that typically the weekly ranges they have a 30 to 50 percent of the weekly range completed between Monday to Wednesday in other words by London close on Wednesday 30 to 50 percent generally the range is completed so what does that mean if we have the willingness to to look for Longs only we expect the market from a discount to a premium to unfold for the week if we do not capture the long either Monday Tuesday or Wednesday and it has happened to potentially form and we've seen some price actions that suggest that that Weekly range is going to be up close or bullish as we expected but we didn't get to trade on uh maybe we're stopped out maybe we missed it all together or maybe we were wrong and we found out later in the week that oh yeah this is probably what's going to happen now because that's going to happen as well uh you may expect something to unfold uh for the week and then it doesn't do that and you have to be flexible and change gears and we're going to talk about that in lesson number seven but if you've missed the Monday through Wednesday phenomenon and the Market's already traded just know that it's important not to get PIP drunk trying to get a lion's portion of a move by Friday's close because the weekly range may end up being smaller or less volatile than you've anticipated so just know that generally a third or half of the weekly range is done by Wednesday's London close and don't expect a massive move higher or lower in in the last two days of the trading week generally if you get an explosive move usually on Tuesday or Wednesday Thursday May see a little bit of following follow through but then Friday has either retracement or does what you see here in the second week where it's basically in neutral close it doesn't really do anything more stunning than what was seen in Thursday or Wednesday's Trading so we're going to build on the idea of this and incorporate how to know when there's going to be an inch or week reversal so until next lesson I wish you good luck and good Trading",
