  "full_text": "okay folks welcome back this is volume 5 in the series of 20 videos from the ICT optimal trade entry pattern recognition series all right so we're looking at the e-mini S&P the June contract for 2020 and I've already given you an example with the ESPE recently in this series it was revolving around the previous week's Friday's high and we put that on here now so we projected that out that was an opportunity here and then later on came back and gave an opportunity to trade into that level again I said it once it got up into that level I'd be done with that idea that trade idea and it has moved over a hundred and thirty handles for the SP which is pretty significant but the framework is obviously it's bearish leading up into the setup or outlining here for our example for May 13 2020 so the previous day's low is here the 12th of May 2020 that's what we would be targeting we're gonna drop down into the 5-minute chart okay so here's the five-minute chart and we're gonna put our lipstick on this pig here here is the previous day or the 12th low below that would be suicide liquidity and we've already outlined the fact on that hourly chart the bearish market structure and seeking liquidity below the previous day's low here's our new york session so inside of this area here okay we're looking for a set up and here's the high we trade down to this low and start retracing inside the new york session trading up into the bearish order block which is that last up close candle right here trades into the butt end of that and your entry would be 2865 in theory stop would be above the high here trading down to the low of the optimal trade entry since we're dealing with the SMP we're not talking about pips so we're dealing specifically with the range so the range low that would offer over 30 handles on the SP and then a second partial at plus 50 handles at half of the projected standard deviation in other words the range is here okay so we have this high to this low half of that range is this level that's what this is all about and in one full standard deviation of this range or a projection down would send us into that twenty seven eighty eight and three quarters for plus seventy five handles for your third partial and look at a beautiful response of that now this is all again based on the liquidity below the previous day's low it's not the magic of the fib the fib has absolutely nothing to do with the reasons why prices going down there the reason why it's going down there is there's a liquidity resting below this low the markets gonna seek that liquidity not always in a single run down into it and I take several passes to get down to it as it does here and then we had a nice little retracement there and we'll probably look forward to grab tape back to the 12th or the low of the twelfth rather so that's going to be it for this example I hope you found it insightful until next time I wish you good luck and good trading",
