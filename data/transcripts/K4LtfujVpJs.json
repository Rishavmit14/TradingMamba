  "full_text": "you I'm going to first talk about impulse price swings. impulse price swings would be something like this. We have an impulse price swing down. Then we have another impulse price swing higher. And we have another impulse price swing lower. And the impulse swing higher followed by an impulse swing lower. And the higher swing of impulse movement higher. Then we have another impulse swing lower followed by another impulse swing higher. followed by an impulse swing lower. Another impulse swing higher. And ultimately, another impulse swing lower. So, we have price swings moving from high down to a low, to another high. down to another low to a high to a low to another high making another low up to a high down to a low up to a high down to a low. When you look at price action you need to be thinking in terms of impulse price swings because inside the impulse price swings it's going to give you a lot of detail. Now there are smaller, more specific impulse price swings that have a lot more influence over the marketplace in the form of a manipulative move or market making manipulation. So let's take all this off and focus primarily on protraction now. If we look at the market with the similar ideas we just illustrated with every impulsive price swing and then we add to a time of day. By holding down control and tapping Y on your keyboard you'll add the vertical denonations for zero GMT. So zero GMT vertical line to another day the lighter basically. When we see this okay then we can look at time sensitive impulse price swings which is market protection. Market protection is time sensitive. It's an impulse price swing that is highly sensitive to a time of day. There are three primary protractionary market moves every 24 hours. The first one is rate at zero GMT. You'll see one little movement away or lower, no words up or down rate at at delineation in time. You see one here it trades down away from it and moves higher. We see this one here it trades down then moves higher. You see this one here it trades higher. This one here it trades higher and that's all we're going to look at for that agent session. I don't believe Asia's that influential initially. To the other market protractionary state is in London. Now we can take the control Y feature off and just focus on the vertical lines here delineating midnight New York. Initially right after midnight New York on this day we have a market move higher. This market move here is a protractionary market phase where the market trades up initially at a specific time of day so there's an impulse price swing here but its design is to fake out the individuals that chase that initial move after midnight. The second impulsive price swing starts in New York. We delineate 7 o'clock in the morning and we anticipate if the market has moved lower in London we're going to be looking for a retracement higher. That impulsive price move higher is market protraction. It's designed and intended for manipulation only. It's to get traders to think that the market's making a low in this case. It rallies up and then trades down ultimately. Here again here's New York time in New York session opening. Market goes into another protractionary market state right after the 7 o'clock hour going into New York open. Small little retracement and then market trades lower. Again 7 o'clock in the morning the market goes into a small impulse price swing higher. This is market protraction. Its intent is for manipulation. It's counter direction. In other words if the move occurs at this time of day if it goes higher we think the opposite direction. If it goes lower we think the opposite direction. So it initially moves higher and the market's been going lower. We see that as manipulation or market protraction. Market's going to seek to draw in participants on the wrong side of the marketplace or reach for liquidity. It has to happen after 7 o'clock in the morning. It has to happen after 7 o'clock in the morning and it has to happen after 7 o'clock in the morning. The other one is in the London session obviously and it's after 4 GMT on the 4x LTD demo account. If we see a movement higher and we're bearish we see that as market protraction or a Judas swing. It's a false rally to sell into. Same thing occurs in after New York 7 o'clock in the morning time. It is a pay of round up off the London high. So when we see that we expect the market to go into a protraction area state where it rallies up to reach for liquidity and then expand down. This day here market drops initially. Right from the midnight candle drops lower then rallies up. So this is market protraction. It seeks liquidity below the market over here, clearing out lows and then rallies. Read it. New York markets one more time little rally in here and then sells off. The next day London we see initial rally after a night candle and then it trades lower. Great after 7 o'clock in the morning New York we get one more protraction area state in the marketplace where the market rallies again. Small minor little impulse price swing but its design is to manipulate the sentiment and or the thoughts of traders wanting to be participants. This would look a low and this run up here with enticed buyers in the New York session and then reverse it. Having these things in mind we can look at the market in the context of what we shared so far for this month. We see a market move down from market impulse price swing. So we can measure that swing down. From the high we can use this one. It's high down to this low and it retraces back up above equilibrium so we go into a premium market at the 62% retracement level. We can sell there with a move expecting to see a run below this low. Market goes in the protraction area phase after an impulse price swing. We can be a seller reaching for liquidity below the lows and looking over here in previous days we can find an old low back here as well and market trades down into that level. Market makes another impulse of price swing here. In this context the market rallies up with an old move higher. In the next London session it's in due to swing lower or market protraction area phase. Faking traders out think it's going to drop initially and it rallies up and it rallies up into the New York session right into a premium market. So we're blending impulse price swings and then time of day. Retrade right back into equilibrium for market protraction right in here and then it expands going lower. Taking out stocks below the lows over here and aiming for the stocks below these equal lows which they accumulate here. Another impulse price swing here down to the low right here. Impulse swing up right at the New York midnight candle due to swing higher fake move higher it trades down. Going into New York we see another protraction area market phase where it trades up right into an area where it sold off before. Lower expansion reaching down into the 32 55 level. Why would it reach down there and why is it quickly moving so fast to go down to that level is because you can see the old low over here. The difference in determining impulse price swings and in market protraction is the fact that there is a time element applied to the small impulse swing after midnight, New York time, after 7 a.m. New York time and 8 p.m. New York time is usually a protraction area market phase that enters the marketplace and it's a small little impulse price swing that's counter the major direction that you're going to see after that specific time of day. So for session trading and for session drills you can use this concept to help give you context in your practicing and also build your anticipatory price skills.",
