  "full_text": "welcome to March 2017 content for the ICT mentorship this month we're teaching short-term trading this is lesson one combining higher time frame monthly and weekly ranges okay folks short-term trading this is my cup of tea if you will my go to discipline trading Style um in this month we're going to be teaching in great detail my one shot one kill approach to trading not just the 4X Market but all the other uh asset classes will be touched on in scope as we get to those later discussions uh in the middle of the summer we will be teaching bond trading uh index trading stock trading and commodity trading and I'll touch on this specific trading model in higher detail when I go into those respective discussions and just so you know it's uh the month of June we go through that that Gambit if you will of those four different asset classes all right so what is short-term trading it's the practice of trading a duration of one week or a few days we use both the monthly and weekly charts to frame the setups we trade in the direction of the present or next week's probable range it's essential that you understand that the weekly range is going to be the backbone to your success in short-term trading and I'm going to go through a lot of teaching and Concepts as it relates to producing consistent results when you're looking for forecasting the next week or current week's range a short-term model can be both Trend or range-bound Trading trades that are clear to see forming are the goal again specifically with this trading model try your best to keep from forcing yourself to take a trade if it's not obvious it's simply just you know not clear enough on on your charts just simply sit on your hands and wait these types of setups form every single week there's absolutely no reason for you to rush if you do believe me you will have psychological tug of war going on you're gonna have emotional issues and the bottom line is your ultimately probably going to lose some money short-term trading in my opinion is the highest probability discipline it offers frequent setups and with consistency it provides a plethora of Trades now before we get into this discussion about short-term trading let me preface it by saying it's important you go through your notes from the January long-term trading model and from February with the swing trading model notes because those notes will complement this specific whole entire month it'd be very easy for me to load you down with rehash of everything that was discussed in January and February but what I want to do is I want to keep things moving along number one I want the lessons to be fresh and I also want you to be forced if you will to go back to your notes it's simply me giving you the PF File is not enough you need to be referring to them every single month you get something new when you finish that new month go back from the previous months and go through all those lessons again and yes it takes a lot of time that's why we're doing a 12-month mentorship it takes a great deal of time to go through this information to digest it to retain it and then to be able to use it it's simply not enough to give me this and then I'll know what to do it's not it doesn't work like that and obviously some of you already realize that and it's requiring you a great deal more work but the ones that are doing it guess what you already see the fruits of that so while many of the folks on the internet think they understand how I do one shot one kill believe me there's a whole lot of things that I did not reveal in the first four lessons of this month will look somewhat like you have already seen it already but there's subtle nuances especially with one specific uh component that I'm going to release at the very last slide in this presentation I want you to be really focused on because it really is in my opinion one of the telltale signs that you got a tiger by the tail in other words you have a big move still and I'll get to that when we get to the last slide in this presentation but I want you to know that when we go through short-term trading this is my favorite form of trading if I can't find a setup for one shot one kill the next thing I'm doing is day trading and guess what we teach that next month but this month and next this is where I excel as a Trader because of my personal unique uh makeup as a Trader and as a person my psychology about things in nature is very short term I can change my mind very quick I can make a decision rather quickly so that means that I can do very well in this specific discipline of trading and with intraday day trading so while this may not be your particular style Trading trust me I'm going to teach you things in this month and next month that will help you really really Excel as a long-term Trader or a swing Trader everything Blends together that's why we have to do these things from a higher time frame down and we go back to the higher time frame and fill in gaps that were left there intentionally some of you have scratched your head saying well wait a minute I feel like there's some things missing from the swing trading model the things that are missing will be helped by filling in with the short term because everything is modular everything is complementary as we go through deeper study on this mentorship so as we get down to the smaller time frames everything fills in and then you'll go back in the higher time frames and say okay now I know what I'm doing I know what I'm looking for and everything fit together like a dovetail perfectly okay as a reminder every discipline we will always be re referring to the PD array Matrix and I want to not just go over everything that you've seen here so far and I'm not trying to you belaborate but it's important we understand that as a short-term Trader especially for one shot one kill which is the like the flagship of this month's content that's what I'm that's my Hallmark as a Trader I mean that that's what makes ICT Woody is you know I I can trade the weekly range and get pretty close to what the high and low is for the week and you've already seen many examples of me called the intraday highs and lows before the fact within one or two Pips and sometimes rate on the PIP those same components are applicable to the weekly range which if you really stop and think about that think about the Sunday open to Friday's close how many Pips is offered over that time period a lot tons so if you can really focus in on what we're teaching this month even if it's not going to be your discipline of choice or style of trading it will give you a greater Insight on how you can reduce your risk trading as a swing Trader and or a long-term Trader but as it relates to PD array Matrix this is again the backbone to what we look for and how we frame our trades okay so it ends up in every one of our teachings as we go forward in each new discipline this slide will always be there because I want to ingrained in your brain okay because this is what I do from an Institutional mindset I look for how the institutions will move from a premium to a discount array or from a discount array to a premium array you have to understand that and just an example let's just take a look at one real quick it's saying we looked at the market and it just recently filled in a fair value Gap okay and we think the Market's bearish well we go through this uh process of looking for potential future discount PD arrays and we look and we can't see anything in terms of the bullish mitigation block we don't see any bullish Breakers there's no liquidity void but there is no fair value gift either all of a sudden it reduces us down to a bullish order block so if we're looking at a monthly higher time frame premium array we're looking for a opposing weekly discount array so in this case we'd be looking for the movement from a fair value Gap that has filled in at a premium level we're dropping down and looking for a weekly discount array and if our analysis leads us to only a bullish order block below us in the weekly format or time frame that's the range that we're going to be looking for that's your potential range that's how much you can frame your risk to reward model that's the range you're trading that's not um to be broken up and looked at as okay well if this range is 300 Pips I'm just going to take 20 Pips and be done with it no you're going to look to frame your trades as you scale out you're holding for these longer term objectives throughout the week you're going to be learning to take some profits along the way but you're holding out ultimately with that last portion of your trade to get down to that bullish order block this is just one example it could be any combination of how a premium moved to a discount array or a discount array moves up to a premium terms of reaching for how the market May reach in terms of moving higher or lower and I'll say this in simple terms all we're doing is looking for a monthly PD array whether it's discount or premium based on our next logical price move has it gone most likely higher or lower from where we're right now and we move from a monthly PD array now if it's bullish obviously we're gonna be focusing on a monthly discount array if it's bearish we're looking for a premium monthly array from that monthly array you're going to look for an opposing weekly array so if we're starting from a premium and a monthly basis you're gonna be looking for a weekly discount that's your target you're looking for that range to close in or the market to be drawn to that level now if you're not really paying attention if that didn't hit you hard believe me when you go through all your charts go back and look at every major move that's what's been going on that's what makes my ability to call the markets from one level to the next and be pretty solid in terms of why I think the Market's going to go One Direction over the other when I'm not confident about that it's because I don't I don't know which PD array is going to be used next so I'm waiting for more information or the PD arrays have been expired they've already been traded to so you have to look for something new and that means you have to wait but guess what that does it gives you context and also gives you patience it gives you the ability to wait now you know what you're waiting for because right now I can't do anything so when we go through this process of eliminating or what's available in terms of active PD arrays we start from a monthly where what is the monthly PD array that we're most actively traded from is it coming off of a bear shorter block okay great so what's the weekly discount already it's going to be reaching for there may not be a mitigation block there may not be a bullish breaker there may not be a void or a gap there may not even be a bullish order block that you could Fame around confidence it may be a series of all Down Candles so what does that mean you look for a rejection block or an old low an old High another example would be if we were looking from a discount monthly array up into a weekly premium array we could be looking for the market moving from a bullish breaker for instance and we could potentially look for the market to possibly run to an old high or an old low again that would be your potential range this is the maximum you're leaving your portion of your trade on to reach for it may not get to these objectives but if you leave a little piece on many times you're going to find that if you do this you can actually make more than the trade if you had on the full position and left it you know to your first objective and just simply took it all off there that small little portion if you leave it on and you hold it for your maximum potential that little portion many times will be what you would be making entirely if you just took first profit at a smaller lesser objective okay higher time frame sequence we've seen this slide before but now we're making one more addition and we're making some additional notes as well when we're looking for shorting opportunities we're moving from a monthly chart cell program it means we're looking for the market to move away from a premium array and we're moving down into the lower time frame which will be the weekly chart and we're looking for it to become a cell program as well so we're looking for the market to move away from its premium arrays down into a lower time frame daily or watching for price to move away from its individual premium arrays down into a four hour chart looking for a cell program as well moving away from its premium raise down into a one hour chart where we're again looking for the market to move away from their premium arrays so if we look at the slide here to the right we have the monthly the weekly the daily the four hour and the one hour and we're focusing on the monthly chart is we're looking for a premium array to trade off of North that's going to be our point of origin from the monthly weekly daily and four hour these time frames you're scanning searching and trying to determine all of the PD arrays not just premium and not just discount we're looking for all of them from each time frame because all of them will give us potentially new setups short-term trading or one shot kill setups and also if we're looking for a move in this case a selling opportunity and we're framing it off of a monthly PD array from a premium level that means we're in basically an overbought condition and we're going to be watching and expecting the price to move lower to trade down into a weekly discount so if we're going to look at the monthly the weekly dealing for our own both premium and discount basis as we've already talked about in previous disciplines and teachings in December and January when we do this if we're bearish if we're looking for the monthly premium arrays to influence price to go lower why is it important to look at the monthly weekly daily and four hour discount arrays because we're looking for these arrays in the discount form to break we want to see them break and we want to see them continuously keep breaking until we get down to our weekly discount array so for framing a monthly premium PD array we're expecting lower prices from a monthly level and we're trying to get down into a weekly discount now it could be any one of the discount arrays whichever one appears on the chart or the market that you're trading not every pair or Market has every single discount array there's only a few that can exist very rarely have you ever seen more than three so if you focus on what you're looking for in terms of monthly down into a daily it gives you a very clear-cut thing to look for there's not a a plethora of things to choose from or well there's so many things that could be Michael you know which level is it no it's very obvious we're framing the market contextually and conceptually so it gives us a way to break down the marketplace and Define where that market May most and obviously likely reach to so we're Scouting For opposing PD arrays from the monthly down into a weekly discount so again monthly premium level and we're trying to look for an opposing weekly pdra in the form of a discount from that monthly premium array we drop down into a weekly daily and four hour at every premium array for each one of those time frames and we're scanning for all of the premium arrays where we can take short-term trades from as a short every one of those at the weekly daily and four hour if we find a level like that we refine it all the way to the one hour chart our one hour chart is our executable time frame for one shot one kills or short-term Trading once you have that executed what we're doing is we're aiming for that Weekly discount PD array there's your cycle that's your process that's your whole uh outline if you will what we do with the information we learned from January and February and what we're learning so far is we're taking all this conceptually and breaking it down into a user-friendly format we want a monthly premium array and we start there we're looking for a opposing weekly discount whatever that range is it may be hundreds of Pips or it could be a thousand Pips I don't know it's going to be unique to each market and environment but we may have missed the real opportunity to trade off of that monthly premium maybe you just sat down the insurance said oh look at this it's coming off of a monthly bearish order block so it's already moved away from it you can't really use that to trade off of you just know that it's moving lower so what do you do next you drop down to a weekly what's the weekly premium arrays there may be one it trades up to later on or a daily chart it may trade up into a daily premium array or a four hour one of those four time frames is going to give you a setup based on the fact that the monthly premium is overbought most likely are going to trade lower and we're going to be looking for a lesser time frame discount array what's less than a monthly a weekly we execute regardless if it's on a weekly daily or four hour premium level from a one hour chart we get down to the discount on a weekly that's our objective throughout the time from that execution if it's a weekly or it's a monthly level we could potentially see multiple short-term trades form if it's from a four hour basis you won't see that many charge setups form but nonetheless there's still gonna be high probability okay for buying opportunities the same thing is this repeated this in opposite we're going to be looking for a monthly chart by program so we're going to be looking at a monthly discount array and we're gonna be looking for it to go into a buy program in which we're expecting higher prices weekly chart we drop down into it and we start looking for all the discount PD arrays as well and we look for the daily chart to also move away from its discount arrays and then dropping them to a lower four hour and then alternating down to a one hour chart looking at all of the discount PD arrays to offer support and price but ultimately we're framing it off of whatever the monthly chart discount array is that's the beginning basis point so we're starting from a monthly level we're finding a discount if we're oversold or for any uh really deep discount Market in other words it's traded for a long time lower and we found some old institutional price models for bullish institutional order flow for instance a bullish order block an old high or an old low whatever is caused the market to trade higher in the past all those are potential scenarios we're looking for a lower time frame opposing PD array in this case we're looking for a weekly premium array we're scouting opposing PD arrays but we're starting from that monthly basis for a discount so the Lesser time frame from a monthly is a weekly and the opposing from a discount is premium so we're looking for an over sold condition on a monthly to a higher time frame premium array that would be seen on a weekly chart so that would give us a relatively intermediate term overbought scenario it helps us frame the model without using any indicators once we arrive at discount monthly PD arrays we go down through the monthly the weekly the daily and the four hour to reference all of its individual unique discount arrays every single one of these even if we missed the monthly discount array and prices already moved away from it we can't use it but we can refer to it as an indication that markets wanting to go higher so therefore we're identifying that Weekly premium level as a Target so whatever that range is that's what we're waiting for it to trade up to between them two points there may be thousand or hundreds of Pips in terms of the difference between the monthly discount level and the weekly premium so we drop down to the weekly the daily and the four hour for all of the discount PD arrays but which order blocks bullish Breakers bullish mitigation blocks liquidity voids below current market Action Fair Value gaps below current market action uh rejection blocks old candle bodies with long Wicks below it uh maybe want to reach down below that or it could be just a run on an old low or return back to an old high historically those are all discount arrays we look for them from the monthly and then drop down to a weekly find whatever they are there on that time frame then the daily and the four hour any one of those time frames okay we're searching and determining whatever the PD arrays are from the discount basis but we're framing the directional move from the monthly we time all of those potential setups with the one hour chart aiming for that Weekly premium array and again it could be multiple short-term trades forming between the monthly the weekly and daily getting to that Weekly premium array again if we drop down to a four hour chart once we get into the four hour the trades start to fall off a lot in terms of the frequency or multitude okay if we look at how we can use the same model dropping down from a weekly chart we can start from a weekly premium looking into a lower time frame daily discount and we're gonna be scouting opposing PD arrays respectively and from a weekly from to daily to a four hour we're looking for all the premium arrays that we could short from and we key off of whatever they are we wait for price to trade to them and then we use the one hour chart to sell short from that's our executable time frame aiming for that lower level time frame daily discount this my friends is the one shot one kill setup this is my bread and butter this is the one that has consistent setups every single week There's Something to trade off of but you have to go through the process of waiting for it to give it to you the opposite is same here when we're looking for a weekly discount ing an opposing PD array for daily premium level we drop down from the weekly the daily and the four hour looking for all the discount PD arrays executing on any one of them from a one hour chart and again this is the one shot one kill setup for longs okay we talked about the swing trade progression and it's important to bring this back up again because without this understanding it's going to be a little too vague but I gave you a model at which we thought that maybe this is a six month outlook on price okay maybe it's a little aggressive to say six months but just sort of sake of argument and discussion let's just say this whole entire range of higher highs and higher lows is six months and we had the benefit of forecasting the potential move to see this unfold each one of these price legs has a impulse leg and it has a retracement then it's an expansion swing inside of each individual impulse swing there could be smaller impulse and expansion swings each expansion swing again just like we saw in the impulse swing could be broken down to a smaller time frame seeing its own individual unique impulse swing and expansion swing and this is repeated throughout the entire fractal that is seen in price as a short-term Trader with this alone there is a plethora of many many setups and signals that you can find just trading with one market one pair if this is a whole landscape if you will of six months of price data this could be every load that it trades from And Trades higher every single time it makes a loan moves up graphically that is a potential short-term trade so just from this chart alone if you take a moment and count every time it creates a move up use that lowest point at which you could frame a short-term trade count them I'll give you a moment to do so there's potentially just on Longs there's eight short-term setups here just by breaking the fractal down one scale but we can go further than that and break down the smaller swings into their individual impulse swing retracement and expansion swing and it's smaller expansion swing can be further broken down each individual fractal can be broken down to a lesseractile now if we count how many opportunities you could be a buyer when you're bullish and you can frame the marketplace correctly how many opportunities do you see here in terms of potential buys there's potentially 16 buying opportunities in this overall fractal that's not counting any short-term trades that you could have done on all the retracements every little red section in here they could also be short-term trades as well if we couple those with the buying opportunities there is a great deal more trades that are available as a short-term Trader okay the general concept Revisited we're looking for a market that is poised to trade higher on a higher time frame now we're going to be looking for seasonal Tendencies to help us we don't require it but they're always going to be a bonus and we're looking for interest rate driven conditions in other words is there the bond market is it moving is it stagnant it's going sideways preferably we're looking for a market that's moving around uh dust commitment Traders support the hedging program about the commercials are they buying are they selling in this case if we're looking for a bull scenario we're looking for commercials to be lessening their short positions or aggressively adding or already net long and we're using inter-market analysis to support bullishness that could be in the form of supporting with smt Divergence or correlated pair smt we're looking for a market that rallies higher than retraces and this is going to occur Monday through Wednesday so now we're getting more time specific and then we look for the market to expand up into higher highs so before we do anything we're going to already have our point of origin in other words that's going to be the reference point from the monthly standpoint and or dropping down to the weekly daily and four hour and we're going to know what PD array in the premium we're aiming for so we see that impulse swing Monday Tuesday or Wednesday we were looking for an up move to suggest it is in fact buying so that impulse swing is The Telltale sign that there are smart money players in the marketplace pushing price higher that's what we're looking for underlying we're expecting higher prices anyway but now we're seeing it we're waiting for the retracement that retracement is going to come again between Monday Tuesday and Wednesday it could happen directly right off of Sunday's rally and then Monday may be the retracement or it could just start right from Monday and have a very shallow retracement of one day between Monday and and Wednesday during that retracement we're going to be looking for or anticipating the next move higher driving its move higher into that premium array that we're looking for that expansion swing is where we're looking to be profitable framing the retracement from the point of origin that's where we're looking for our executable time frame hourly four hour daily weekly monthly discount PD array we're looking for all those potential levels as price starts to drop down now it looks like graphically it's only on Wednesday but for the sake of discussion and keeping the the slide clean this retracement and the discount PD array Matrix is applied through the entire range across the days of Monday Tuesday and Wednesday so in other words what I'm saying is from Monday Tuesday and Wednesday during any retracement lower we're looking for a monthly weekly daily four hour discount array the trade-off of aiming for the weekly premium array and it has to drop down into a Killzone now what kill zones could you be trading uh obviously you all know that I like to trade the London open and I like to trade in New York open ly trading the Aussie kiwi or Japanese Yen you want to be including the Asian session Killzone okay so you can go into my free tutorial stuff and see what that actually is but for a quick down dirty uh time frame what you're looking for is 2300 hours to well basically you're going to be looking at 6 p.m to 9 P.M New York Standard Time whatever time is in New York 6 p.m to 9 00 p.m there's your sweet spot for Asia okay there you go nothing nothing easier than that now and many times it can extend to 10 o'clock but usually you don't want to be doing anything after 10 uh the closer you get to 10 that's kind of like their lunch time so you don't want to do anything around 10. and ultimately if price drops down gives you retracement into a discount PD array from a monthly weekly daily or four hour level you can see that also can be used from an hourly executable time frame so if you get a hourly discount PD array they could be executed on as well inside of a Kill Zone again you're looking for that Monday Tuesday and Wednesday set up but you're aiming for the weekly PD array if you don't watch online kill you're looking for that daily PDA right but framing off of a weekly discount okay the general concept Revisited again in bearish markets we're looking for a market that's poised to trade lower on a higher time frame we're looking for any Market that would potentially move lower seasonally but it doesn't have to we don't need to seasonal fancy there again it's just always a bonus or a plus if you will if we can use a market that has a bearish seasonal tendency our interest rates moving are they stagnant uh preferably we're looking for a market that has the bond market moving all around the tenure notes are moving around that's held in consolidation and commitment to Traders are we looking at a Lessing of long positions by the commercials or are we seeing a heavily net short position being built or are they already net short those are the conditions we're looking for from a cot standpoint and inter-market Analysis supports the bearishness that means smt diversions is indicating weakness or correlated pair smt suggests that there should be a overall sympathy move lower for foreign currencies or for trading stocks you'll learn all that as well with the indices versus the leadership issues and we're looking for a market decline lower than retrace higher during Monday into Wednesday and then we're going to be looking for a market to expand down to lower lows so we have our point of origin from a higher time frame monthly premium array it trades lower impulse swing and then there's a retracement again this is all occurring between Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday any one of those three days this scenario or condition has to be here that retracement has to come up to a level of Premium and then the expansion swing is what we're looking for to be profitable in aiming for the discount array we're framing our trade with premium array Matrix so we're looking for a monthly weekly daily four hour and one hour premium array to Short from in a Kill Zone for time the analysis okay monthly ranges our price is fractal and higher time frame analysis benefits us as a result we note the high and the low of every month candle we note the present range in terms of premium and or discount we consider where price on the monthly will or could draw to in other words what's the most likely Direction there is generally four weekly candles in every monthly candle every week we study where the monthly will likely trade next again all we're doing is looking for probabilities there's nothing that I teach with 100 iron clad this is the way it's going to happen every single time there's no absolutions there's only probability so we're looking from these higher time frames to look for where is it most likely reaching for it because if we're trading off of a monthly chart and we can pick the most probable Direction chances are even if we're wrong you know the lower time frames that we're going to be executing on still might give us opportunity to be paid and in usually monthly ranges we frame trades on the weekly range all right so what's a weekly range uh again price is fractal and monthly analysis Builds on the weekly and we know to high in the low of every weekly candle we note the present range in terms of Premium indoor discount we consider where price on the weekly will or could draw to again what's the most probable Direction in terms of where the weekly chart is trading and where it may rage up or below or two there's generally five daily candles in every weekly candle and every week we study how the weekly trades inside of its monthly range using weekly ranges we frame trades on the daily chart we're watching to see if the weeklies continuously expand and make the larger monthly candle move in the direction we thought they were going to go so each week we're looking for Confluence and confirmation that will be anticipated seeing on the monthly is in fact unfolding because the weeklies will be pushing that direction hopefully in our favor and then making that Weekly range expand every higher or every lower uh weekly candle we'll build that bigger monthly candle in respective Direction okay so let's take a look at an example all right so here we're looking at the Japanese Yen this is a monthly chart and you can see from 2015 Springtime going into June 2015. we saw the Japanese Yen or dollar Yen pair trade up into around the 125.80 level or thereabouts and we moved from a low formed back in 2013 and then we dropped from the 125s into around June of 2016. if you look at the total range we have obviously moved into a discount market and we look at the markets old support levels found at the February 2014 to June 2014 there was a lot of support seen in there so products came all the way down into the point of origin where we think the market will and with the benefit of hindsight here I'm not going to be slicing and dicing charts because we called the Japanese Yen lower which is dollar Yen higher all through the uh the months in 2016 as we see here but looking at this example we have a point of origin where we think price may want to go higher and once we see that we start looking at all of the monthly discount PD arrays I'm framing the last down candle right before the Big Move starts to take place that is a monthly candle and we start looking at the monthly range but that's not the monthly range we're trading in that's just a monthly range so don't be this don't be confused when I start talking about monthly ranges I may interchangeably refer to a monthly candle where it's individual or independent range that's not the monthly range that we're going to be referring to I'm actually going to distinguish the two okay so we have that one month's candle range defined and we're going to go back to on the monthly level where are our monthly premium arrays well you have a breaker here so we frame that so there's a move that we can look up to for a monthly level so we have both our monthly discount and premium arrays this is our monthly range this is our range for trading the monthly range in other words what's our probable range of probability or profitability where would we expect to see moves take place we take that range and we apply it to a weekly chart and refine that down into this individual weekly PD arrays in terms of a premium array so we have here weekly premium arrays outlined I didn't put every single one of them on here just to keep the chart clean so that way we can go through and have many examples for your study go through and find out where all the other ones are okay go through the individual weekly chart and monthly chart and you can see how price had respected a lot of the other ones too that aren't being used here if I just gave you the obvious ones I use rejection blocks here for weekly and premium arrays so when price broke away from that 104 35 level and started expanding reaching up into that 1860 level that Weekly premium array it had three lesser lower weekly premium arrays old lows seen through 2014 going into 2015 and then we saw rejection block around the 111 level then we saw another rejection block around the 106 Big figure as noted here so they're all objectives are where price should reach up to so if you look at that it's still a great deal of opportunity between just those four premium arrays on a weekly chart dropping down into a daily chart you can see a little bit more detail and how price had reached from the 104.35 up to each one of those weekly premium arrays all being catalysts for higher prices now we got into a four hour chart we can start applying all of the order block Theory and rejection block Theory and we're also incorporating now the day of week filter which is Monday Tuesday Wednesday so I've shaded where every Monday Tuesday and Wednesday's range is and I'm also highlighting order blocks for bullish buy and I'm also highlighting mitigation and also highlighting rejection blocks all of these are discount arrays and the red shaded area up is a 118 70 level or thereabouts that's the premium array on a weekly basis that we're reaching for so how many buying opportunities did you see here six one each week let's break it down a little bit more detail again taking all the unnecessary things off the chart and you can see how price has moved rather uniformly and systematic each new week giving you buying opportunities and I will add all the individual day dividers and I want you to take a look at something as the weekly ranges defined by the double line vertical dashed lines okay that delineates the Sundays so everything to the right of those double vertical lines that are dashed that represents a Sunday's Trading to the right of it you have Monday Tuesday and Wednesday shaded notice how the lows of the week are generally formed in Monday Tuesday and Wednesday in this context also notice that when you see the high that's formed between Monday and Wednesday say for instance that there's a high that forms uh during the Monday through Wednesday range when that high is taken out intra week this is significant because price will tend to expand aggressively towards the monthly and or weekly premium array and it's reversed if it's bearish so what we're doing is we're looking for the Monday through Wednesday range every single week when that is bullish underlying in the market and if you break that range that's defined by technically Sunday's opening but just for the sake of keeping things germane and and consistent because I did mention how we didn't really refer to Sundays anymore you can use Sunday for completeness sake but from a Monday's opening to Tuesday and Wednesday's range whatever the highest high is when months when when the markets are bullish if that high is broken intra week say for instance on Thursday or uh you know Friday generally that is indicative of an aggressive confirmation that we're going to be moving to our premium array that we were looking for or identified ahead of time and everything you see here would just be reversed for bearish markets Monday through Wednesday's range if that is broken when it's bullish the high that's formed between Monday and Wednesday that is a confirmation that you are in a buy program and the markets will expand aggressively to reach for your higher level premium array when the markets are bearish the low that's formed between Monday through Wednesday if that is broken on an intra-week basis that is confirmation that you are an aggressive sell-off or sell program and your long-term higher time frame discount or rate that you're aiming for it's a high probability condition that's going to reach for that may not happen that week but you're going to keep looking for the next week to be bullish or bearish respectively based on that information so hopefully you found this teaching insightful we're going to be building on a lot of these ideas in a lot more detail leading into the ultimate delivery of one shot one kill in a process oriented rule-based breakdown what you do from the beginning to end to execution and until next session I wish good luck good Trading",
