  "full_text": "welcome back folks this is video number 12 in our continuing series of 20 videos for the ICT optimal trade entry pattern recognition series alright today's example is a commodity futures and it's a Mexican peso so we already have our chart trained on the 5-minute and take a look at what you see here before I put the annotations on pause the video ok so we'll add our annotations and here's yesterday's high Thursday's daily high and during the New York session we have an optimal trade entry in here and you'd see 1/2 standard deviation 1 full standard deviation takes us above Thursday's daily high and why don't have two is a little too rich for today but that's okay the model that I'm teaching is simply looking at a run above previous day's high or below previous day's low and you can see that there is a 47 pip opportunity here and a 4 to 1 reward of risk so not a bad little trade you might want to take a look at the Canadian dollar today in your own study and there was an opportunity for a continuation on the dollar cad it gave you an optimal trade entry today in the new york session so I'll leave that for your own personal study and homework until talk to you next weekend I wish you good luck and good trading",
