  "full_text": "welcome back folks this is volume number 17 in a continuing series of 20 videos for the optimal trade entry pattern recognition series for the inner circle trader YouTube channel our example today is from the British pound or pound versus dollar and we're looking at the daily chart here and I'm gonna save you a lot of time and just simply state that we have retail resistance up here and that's going to be likely a draw on liquidity now here's one of the things that you're gonna have in your notes when you're looking at a daily chart like this it's not important or even required that price trades from this level here all the way up to that level and higher it just needs to draw towards it that's the reason why I call a draw and liquidity now again the ideal scenario would be to see price trade up there but it's not required if especially if we're looking for day trades or intraday trades which is the scope of this series focusing primarily for moves within the 8:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. New York session so here is last Friday's daily range and we expect these highs to draw a price up now again it's not imperative that it goes all the way up there but it's more likely to go that direction than it is to go lower so we would put our line on the daily high which comes in at 123 94 in one pip at and we're gonna go over to our 5-minute chart okay so here's our British Pound 5-minute chart and you know the drill pause your video okay so let's add the annotations now and right away you can see we have our optimal trade entry price and move here drops down in after 8:30 a.m. move drops down into the 62% trace minute level our hypothetical entry is 123 and 88 and it suffers 3 pips drawdown stop-loss is 15 pips which puts it just below this low here at the old high we have a 1 to 1 right away at the old high at plus 15 pips at 1/2 a standard deviation it's up 29 pips 43 pips at 1 standard deviation 1 and a half standard deviations takes us to plus 56 pips and ultimately at 2 standard deviations where we would kill the trade at 70 pips now obviously in hindsight you can see it went a little bit further but again I'd lean on the fact that the rules for this model says we have to bail on the day trade at 2 standard deviations again it's gonna be trades if you follow this model it's going to leave money on the table hypothetically and you're either gonna have to accept that or again if you think you're going to go higher than that leave a leader in oh it's a small portion of your original position to see if you can capture anything especially based on what we showed on that daily chart so that's going to do it for today hopefully you found this insightful until next time I wish you good luck and good trading",
