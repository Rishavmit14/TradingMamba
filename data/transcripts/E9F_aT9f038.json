  "full_text": "Well, hello folks. Long time no see. If you're like me, the present conditions around the world right now because of the illness that's been plaguing everyone. I thought of everyone on the YouTube channel that has supported this channel and maybe has been longing for some inspiration, maybe some kind of a nudge by Giro I CT. So I came here with the expectation that I would give the next four weeks or 20 trading days. Just a snapshot real quick, kind of like train your eye to see the optimal trade entry and its many formations and subtle nuances. Now it's not a signal service. So that way you guys didn't like to do the thumbs down button which I love that. The content I'm going to be providing you here is just really to activate your articulating system. I mean train your eye to see what it looks like and how it tends to form. So for some of you that are very versed in my content and old stuff in the classic ICT library, the optimal trade entry is a really an old staple. Now it's not important for me to go through the entire optimal trade entry and all the levels and all that stuff. You'll see what they are obviously in the examples. But if you have not watched the optimal trade entry or OTE primer video you can do a search on YouTube and you'll see it pops up. Watch that video and kind of gives you a kind of a foundation up how to set your fit and all that business. So if we are looking at the next 20 days just know that these videos are not intended to be very very long. I want to try to get right to the point but this is the first one in a series so I kind of like want to take a little bit of liberty to remind the individuals that are probably just new to me or the hardline critics that just can't stand me. I love you too. The again the premise behind all this is again not to say here's what the market's going to do next. Okay that's not what I'm doing here. Okay what I'm showing you is how you go into your charts and annotate them. Look for the optimal trade entry because this is how I trained myself to see it back in the 1990s. I worked just like everyone of you and I came home and I had to look at charts and look at moves that I missed. So I taught myself to look for specific patterns and signatures and price action over a period of years and because of that and seeing it over and over and over again it builds in a pseudo experience. In other words I at the time was not able to see these formations form live so I would go back and look at my charts and annotate them in capacity as if I were really there watching it and annotating the chart as if it was something I watched and witnessed live. Now I'm not going to annotate the charts to the degree that I personally would do it but I'm going to provide you a kind of a baseline to work with and you can dress up your own charts and annotations and draw a great deal of attention to other things that may be important to you okay or your unique price action model. I'm not teaching bias I'm not teaching how to find the right order blocks okay I'm not doing all that it's just again to train your eye to see a specific phenomenon that takes place in the marketplace and again some of you are going to say oh this is something that everybody knows about it's a Fibonacci retracement ICT didn't invent it and it's this and it's that okay if that's your attitude that's how you think if that's your going into this video I'm really going to waste your time and just know that if you're that person I enjoy that where everyone else it wants to really learn how to do something I want you to see what it's like over and over and over again over a period of four weeks okay so if anything is studied for a month basically it really starts to take root in number one your memory and your identification okay the faculties that each of us have to see something that is important to us it has to be activated okay and real short and sweet the common example I always use is if you buy a car and you've looked forward to buying this car and once you buy you take it home and the very next day you're driving it it might be the day you come home with it you start noticing that a lot of other people seem to have that same car and it's not that more people bought it because you did but your reticular activating system has been keyed up okay to filter that car because it's meaningful to you and so by me showing you examples of this particular pattern and the signatures that generally repeat with it you're going to see how you can start doing this on your own and then if you have the the ability to watch it live you'll see many times its formation and then you'll grow in your confidence to paper-trade it then demotrate it and if you feel inclined to do so if you've shown six months of consistency you want to dabble with a very very small amount of money live money nothing big nothing grandiose the smallest amount of money you can open up an account with and then trade the smallest little lot size as possible and then again just follow the same protocols and procedures that would otherwise lead to your trust and find the in price action you determine that on your own I don't ever sell anybody say okay go trade with live money because there's a lot of responsibility in that and legally I can't tell you to do that but I can talk about price action and I can talk about the signatures that repeat themselves and I only want to talk about the optimal trade entry okay so please don't try to reach out to me and say hey can you talk about this can you do that I'm only going to be doing just this okay so again every video I'm gonna try to aim at five minutes or less but this one just has to be it's just a little bit long-winded because I have to have a preamble to set the stage for what it is I'm doing so that way no one can say you said it was gonna be this and it's not okay so if you're serious about understanding the things that I'm making available to you on this YouTube channel one of the hallmarks is the optimal trade entry so again watch the optimal trade entry primer video first and then come back to this series okay so again it'll be 20 videos in the series and I'll try to create a playlist that way you guys can find it very easily and be able to go through it but tonight as the pilot episode we're looking at the Australian dollar okay so I'm using TradingView.com as the resource and platform and the data I'm pulling up is the Australian dollar versus the US dollar 4x.com so whenever you put this symbol over here it's gonna give you a sort of different data feeds and I always use the 4x.com so that way you guys can see the the price action the same way as I'm presenting it here all right so when we look at the optimal trade entry and way we look at its formation on a day by day daily basis now again I'm not trying to push or entice or convince that you should be day trading every single day okay that's not what this is I can but I've been doing this for almost three decades so many of you are very very new and there's nothing wrong with that but you cannot speed this process up it has to be done methodically it has to be done in a way where it just allows for development and not rush you can't rush it okay so if you look at this particular currency pair some of you that are familiar with my concepts right away know that there is the sensitivity off of this low here and this low here is inside of these two consecutive downclose candles that's your order block so it's going to be important for the discussion just simply because of this video but every video after this I'm only going to go right into the day and reference the previous days range and show you how the optimal trade entry formed so if you learn this okay if you grow in comfort and identifying this over a period of time what period of time minimum four weeks daily study now that doesn't mean four weeks you graduate now your optimal trade entry master it just means that you're very familiar with it and you have a little bit of a sample size of experience you want to build on that how long it will take for you to get really I guess used to seeing the pattern and anticipating when it's going to form that's going to be different for every single one of you so it's not here's a general rule of thumb or everybody gets it by this time no mentor no teacher no educator can say everyone's going to get it by this timeline so be very flexible with your development on your personal development not comparing yourself to someone else okay so when we look at price action on a daily chart the main thing we're looking for is the reactions from the previous days range okay so this is the day that we're gonna study because this is a new trading day now but we're gonna be looking at this particular day here and I already hear all the people here it is it's hindsight again okay for those that are new put the fact that it's hindsight aside for a moment because every single thing that you study when you buy a book a newsflash that's all hindsight too when you go to a seminar or webinar and they show you previous examples that's all hindsight too so you'll learn by identifying a pattern that repeats okay so I'm teaching you a pattern of what it looks like and how it generally forms okay so if you do this if you learn to do this very very well this could be your personal trading model you never need to learn anything else you never worry about indicators you never worry about learning anything else in the ICT library you don't even worry about mentorship you don't worry about going over here and signing up with signal services because you will be your own power plant of decisions and ideas and trade setups they'll come organically from your own study not relying on other people not relying on me not people in chat rooms or or groups nothing like that okay the big thing now is everyone's going to discord rooms okay or telegram rooms all these things and they're all looking for someone that's good today can copycat off of and you don't need that you're absolutely in a position to learn how to do this for free right here and you don't need to have anybody else to convince you or patch on the back to say follow me because I'm gonna do it and you're gonna copy up because that makes you subservient to them and that's not independent thinking and to me personally I think it's weakness and you don't want to be a weak-minded decision-maker in something like this because you have the capacity to lose a great deal of money for trading with life funds right so the downclose candles in here that's our water block we had a candle trade down into it and then the previous day now again kind of like just move this candle out of here focus don't think that anything about this candle right now we're only focusing on this candles range and the previous day which is the sixth of May okay so in the United States right now it's eight forty one p.m. New York local time and it's still the seventh for me but it's a new financial day in the 4x so that's how we're seeing this candle form so when we look at the previous days range it's important to just simply identify the highs and the lows of it okay so right away we know this candles high and if we looked at these two downclose candles and the fact that we traded down into it here we had a candle trade again a little bit into the water block the water block is starting at the wick okay so this candle's high comes in at sixty three ninety seven of four pipettes the price action dips into that candle range and it does it again on the seventh okay so it's not showing a willingness to go deeper it doesn't want to dig in deeper and even take out the low over here so we have to consider at least for this episode for this particular video the likelihood of the market wanting to go higher so what we want to see is does it have the ability on the the very next day or the May seventh candle does it have the ability to trade above the previous days range high why is that important for those to have a serious interest in falling along and keeping up with this series you want to take notes okay so get yourself a pen and pad and just I guess make a study journal just for optimal trade entry okay so the next twenty days I'm going to give you simple little facets that go along with this pattern and you'll see that it will flesh out over a period of time and you'll start seeing things that you didn't really see before even if you're familiar with the optimal trade entry so we're gonna go down to a lower time frame and these levels here are gonna be on the lower time frame chart but this study over the next 20 days is going to focus on intraday charts and specifically a five-minute chart and right away some of you're like I don't like five-minute charts I can't do that trust me it's beneficial to your learning all right so what we have here is to blank canvas in the form of candlesticks that may or may not mean anything to you but I want to press upon you the importance of knowing the previous days high and low and it's a very simple process you can go into your charts intraday and put vertical delinesions on the seventh and the sixth so the range low on the sixth is here and the range high is here so when we know that on the daily chart okay above previous days highs and lows let me say like this above previous days highs and below previous days lows there's a bank of orders that generally reside in the marketplace and throughout the day depending upon how we get closer to the previous days high or low on the new trading day and the new trading day in this example here is the seventh so we're assuming all this price action here is what we're studying when the market has a predisposed bias or trend or momentum or you just think okay that it's going to go higher you want to focus on the previous days high and then you want to see does it have the ability to stretch and reach up to the previous days high if it does one of two things generally happens and assuming it's bullish one it goes through the previous days high and this explodes and never gives you a chance to trade and that's just a missed opportunity and there's nothing you could do about it there's no reason to get upset about it there's no reason to go online and complain to other people how you missed that trade or you suck or you're you're never gonna get this never do that because you're actually giving yourself negative reinforcement and you're subconscious will remember that and every trade you take after that trade will be plagued by that negative narrative that you've given yourself that you suck you're never gonna get this so every time you actually muster up the courage to get in actually execute you're gonna be scared you're gonna be constantly revved up you're gonna be in a constant state of stress and anxiety versus just following the method you've adopted and focusing on what price is doing is it still viable in terms of a trade or should you collapse it or maybe take some of the risk off or stick with it because it's now to move in your favor when we look at previous days highs and previous days lows we want to see the market go up above it and then once it trades to the previous days high if we're bullish we want to see does it create an optimal trade entry because many times you're gonna see this formation formed exactly like I'm showing you here okay lots and lots of times do you see this formation form throughout the week and it may not be that particular currency or this currency in this example here Australian versus the dollar it may be in euro it may be in cable it may be in the beast pound versus yen it may be the New Zealand dollar it may be in gold it may be in a crypto currency okay it it's not limited to just one currency stick to it and always expected to happen like that when you understand this pattern you can mark out your previous days highs and lows and if there is a very discernible clear unambiguous directional bias that lends well to one particular currency or two over the other basket of currencies that you follow then that means that you've very easily filtered out all the other currencies so now you're gonna focus on maybe one or two for that particular day and then wait to see if it trades to and through the previous days high if it's bullish or below the previous days low if you're bearish now with these ideas mentioned in general bullet point fashion as I've just given you let's flesh this idea a little bit and put some lipstick on this pig here okay so we got the vertical delineation here on the sixth and the seventh so between those two vertical lines we have the highest high and the lowest low as I denoted on the chart here previous days high previous days low and here's the daily bullish order blocked as I outlined on the daily chart before we moved down into lower timeframe all right so the previous days high on this particular candle here we have 6445 and three pipettes and in the next candle is the very highest high at 6453 okay so there's our high so think in terms of round numbers and big figures and mid figures okay so essentially this high being 53 even if that's the high what is it really trading around 6450 mid figure so it's the midpoint between 6400 and 6500 so the mid figure levels are very significant they're important couple that with the fact that this high and this high here are basically relatively the same high above this clear area that would otherwise be viewed as retail resistance traders think that this offered resistance here it offered resistance here and as it starts to break down anyone going short they would feel very comfortable putting a stop loss above these highs because they feel with visual support behind the theory that this is resistance so there's going to be a bank of orders that reside above this because it's the previous days high when we're looking at over here and the fact that we have relative equal highs so there's going to be a layer of liquidity above these highs and above the mid figure okay so 6450 which is this black line here and in 10 pips above it which is 6460 and 10 pips below it is 6440 so we have a standard deviation of 10 pips now I don't want to make it too complicated but just understand that what I'm showing you here this is about the general rule thumb you're going to get that seems really technical just know that whenever we have a previous high or previous low how I did this here I would do the same thing around this low here because the low in this candle comes in at 63 78 so we have an institutional level of 80 so if you're again if you're new here 00 level 0.80 or 80 in this case here 50 mid figure and 0.20 or 20 in instance for Australian dollars so you have mid figure levels that's very sensitive 80 level 20 and the 00 levels now why are these levels important why they significant is because a lot of large fund traders make their orders very easy for processing and they just put them in there at that level a lot of commerce gets done at those levels too so when there's global commerce that comes into the marketplace IBM needs to do business in Japan so they have to turn dollars into yen when they put orders in for that transaction it's just easier for the bank to move that into those levels and do the commerce there so again that's not important it's nothing that needs to be known or followed or believed in okay to see this work all we're doing is studying a signature in price action that will tend to repeat a lot and this is one of the formations of optimal trade entry and why it forms here okay so again the daily chart we're assuming the previous days high should be traded to and if it does it should be bullish and look to see higher prices if it goes below the previous days low that means that we can't be as bullish but we can now study to see if we have a bearish optimal trade entry because the previous days low has been violated so there's always a study and it's not about it's very important write this down and underline it several times and highlight it and draw all kinds of you know annotations around the draw your attention how important this is it's not about being right or wrong the study is to show you what it looks like every single day and how you're going to go into the chart so when I show these examples again it's just to train your eye to see the thing I'm showing you over and over and over again and you're going to find that this is exactly what it tends to do in other markets as well it's not just me form fitting it into this one because it looks pretty okay so again the idea is we're looking for the previous days high on the sixth the be traded to it does here and then we consolidate and retrace a little bit and we hang around once it hits that 6450 level which is that black line here it does blow out the previous days high not by much but it does and then it gyrates down 10 pips are a little bit more than that and picks up more orders what is it doing it's gathering more orders here and then there's a displacement here price starts to create a run up above the previous days high with a little more meaningful run so the shallow run here gets overtaken here and then price does what it returns back to the 6450 mid-figure and consolidates in between 6460 6450 and what is it doing it's allowing all the orders that was above the previous days high and around 6450 an order bank gets depleted because of the time it's sitting in here now when I say order bank it's it's basically a huge collection of orders that may or may not be in the marketplace around here but as it sits in here people will start to build a bias or a sentiment about what they think the Australian dollar is going to do in terms of bullishness or bearishness these orders that are accumulated in here are going to build up over time price makes a run above the 6460 level and it starts just get up into the 6470 but it's not important we're looking for price to go to a specific time and a specific price so we're looking at time and price that's what makes optimal trade entry or the ICT optimal trade entry pattern what it is it's not just simply going in there and saying okay every time the price retraces because otherwise that's just Fibonacci trading okay or ratio trading or harmonic trading you know what I'm saying it everyone's got a name for it okay but what I'm showing you what makes this optimal okay is the fact that it's occurring at a key time of day now not key I'm not teaching you I see he kills owns okay I'm gonna make it very very simple it's specific times a window that begins in a window to ends and it we're only focusing during the New York session okay so it's not the New York Kill Zone it's the New York session so it allows a great deal of flexibility and it allows you also to look for this pattern with specific envelopes and time where it begins and ends if it doesn't occur then you can't do anything with it it may form later on and you'll be like oh well I didn't see it then and I didn't take it in so I'm mad don't be mad you only want something that makes sense and a time where you anticipate it occurring this is discipline this is focusing on a rule-based premise and following your price action model this is the way professional traders do it they don't get lacks in their rule rules and and say okay well it was good the last 12 times I did it but this time I just feel lucky and I'm just gonna do things slightly different they don't do that okay generally if you have a model or trading plan you want to stick to the rules and that way you're not going to be confused when things go awry it's just simply a losing trade and you're not going to be able to avoid every instance of that occurring everyone takes losses I take losses I have lost money okay you're going to lose money you can't avoid it it's absolutely gonna happen if you put live money in here you're going to lose money but if you learn how to do this you're gonna see how often this signature becomes very familiar in price action and I'll leave it to you what that means on an individual basis so price stays around and me and there's up and down gyrates until we get to a specific time of the day and this is going to be 8 30 a.m. to 11 o'clock in the morning New York time these are always New York times 8 30 New York time to 11 o'clock New York time do not email me why is this time this and not the New York Killzone times I'm not teaching mentorship I'm not teaching I see T Killzone's I'm teaching you a specific price action model with rule-based ideas and you work with just this okay I'm not reinventing it because my stuff doesn't work anymore okay that's not what I'm doing I'm making a very specific window of time and it's based on New York time so if you want to see the time window I have it set you can see right here this is what I have in my time setting so this is what you'd look for and then your chart will look like mine is here if you live a different time zone a different country then you need to figure out what that time is for you locally and where you live at but this is the time that this pattern tends to form okay now the green shaded area in here is what everyone's familiar with in terms of my pattern the optimal trade entry optimal trade entry is the 62% tradesmen level to the 79% tradesmen level and the mid point or 70.5 level you can see here and these are the levels that are highlighted okay so everything here is what I have on my fit so these are that's the levels that you would have for your Fibonacci over here okay or on trading view so that way it's included now they don't change they're not flipping around and I'm not making it fit because I gotta have a winner every single day that's not what I'm doing here okay so again all of this gyration is just simply working the bank of orders that come and go around that mid-figured level and above the previous days high now remember earlier I said one of two things are gonna happen when you're bullish and if it trades to the previous days high one it takes off and it doesn't give you a chance to do anything and you missed that opportunity or it starts to gyrate around the previous days high okay and you want to know what institutional price level you're working around the closest to it okay so no we're talking about saying closest to the previous days high in this instance it's 6450 and then you do an envelope of 10 pips above that and 10 pips below it and then you you allow basically price to generate a trading range until we get to this little sweet spot in time between 8.30 in the morning why 8.30 for your notes 8.30 there's usually a lot of news that comes out during the New York session okay so the 8.30 news session usually it's like non-farm payroll will come out some other kind of report I don't often talk about what they are and I don't really care to know what they are really because I don't have any real specific affinity for one particular set of data because they always come in and out in terms of what's relevant right now what's the focus right now whereas at the time of this recording employment numbers or the lack of employment is the main focus right now because everyone's at home or without a job because of the illness that's been spreading so when we get to 8.30 you want to see price try to trade when your bullish trade down into 62 to 79% tradesmen level on the fib now that is your range determined from the low to the high once this previous days high is broken if this was a bearish scenario we would just do the opposite of what's being seen here once the low of the previous days low is broken we would use a short term high to a short term low that would be below the previous days low when you're bearish but in this instance obviously we're bullish so we want to use a short term low to the short term high so this range is the range prior to the formation of the New York session of 8.30 in the morning New York time to 11 o'clock in the morning New York time why 11 o'clock that's typically around when London close occurs and usually it's also the time when the AM session starts the Wayne in the New York session and early lunch takers you know they leave the marketplace that volume is no longer available and then through noon to 1 o'clock in the afternoon that's generally the New York lunch and it can be quiet during those times you only want to be looking for this pattern up to 11 o'clock in the morning after 11 o'clock it can form but it's something other than what I'm teaching here and that's not important the point is is you want to see this pattern form during this time of day with the bias determined by what you determine on your daily chart do you think the previous days high is going to be taken out or the previous days low sticking out and here's the thing the beautiful beautiful thing really is is many times you don't even need a bias you just wait for the chart to show you what it's done does it take out the previous days high or the previous days low at this time of day what has it done well the here's midnight in New York and during the London session it created a run higher so there's been a lot of buying taking place to get above the previous days high does it create an optimal trade entry so the low to the high that's what I have the fib drawn on even though it's drug up to here that way you can see all the levels how they line up nicely with time so we have two components here we have the element of time and we have the element of price so price is the level determined by the fib relative to its high and low of that range time is static this is always static it does not change it does not deviate it's 830 in the morning New York time to 11 o'clock it does not change so the easy way to do that is simply just get a horizontal I'm sorry vertical line and put it at these specific times if you do that you know in between these two vertical lines you don't need to have a guess as to when something's going to form you know when when price enters this area between the first vertical line up to the second vertical line you're anticipating an optimal trade entry to form so that's the expectation that you'll have by having your vertical lines on there so you don't right now have a whole lot of business on this chart but you can see clearly that this is what the time element would be to this pattern price is always going to be between 62 percent change level and the 79 percent change level which is 79 here and 62 is just underneath that 50 level okay so 64 50 is this black line here so it cleansed up a little bit okay so you can see 62 79 and 70.5 which is a sweet spot or optimal trade entry okay when price drops down into this level you can be a buyer on paper or demo and I'm not going to say beyond that because I'm not licensed to do that but we're studying price action and you could be a buyer here with the expectation that we would see it expand now I'll get up to here and talk about these levels in a minute but right now this low is where your stop would have to be below that okay so the lowest candle what we're anchoring the fifth one the low is 64 34 and 75 that so you can do a stop at 64 30 okay so here's your stop 64 30 darker colors and you can see so your stop could be at 64 30 so your stop could be at 64 30 your entry could be at the 62 percent change level is 64 49 and 7 pipettes so basically we could just simply say if it trace the 64 50 you can be a buyer okay because you're gonna look for the institutional level and the lower you get down into the 79% trace level the less likely you're gonna get your fill because we demand 79% trace level here you may or may not get that with the spread okay so what I like to use is a 60% trace level and then maybe factor in the spread there but if you're using 62 generally it's a little bit more forgiving because you don't need to add always in my experience using 60% trace level you can absolutely get it because you're gonna dip even further generally into the 17 1 1 2 and sometimes it is a seven times the trace level but that's our range for price and then this is our time window so the fact that we're looking at this specific area if we use a limit order at 62 percent trace level if it trades below that you're filled your stop would be placed here and then using the fifth levels 0.50 or 0.5 negative 0.5 rather this is an area where you take first profit if it allows you if it allows you 15 pips or more okay so there's your rules you want to take 15 pips at first scalp exit at the negative 0.5 level and then the negative one level which would be one standard deviation of the range that you calculate for your fib so now what you're drawing your load to your high here that range here if it's duplicated and basically projected higher a measured move of that would be this level up here now since we have that since it's suggesting here in the fib it's 0.6513 and 5 pips we want the highest degree of probability for our levels for scaling and taking profits this would be an area where we can take profits again so first scaling would be here at negative 0.5 but the minimal expectation is 15 pips so you have to be able to get 15 pips you can't get 15 pips here but you can get it here or more than this is where you would take first profit okay here it's just one level where we'd expect it in this instance here we can see at 6450 or so getting out at 6493 that's 43 pips almost or 43 pips of potential profit at first scaling the next level up here would be 6513 and 5 but it may not get to these levels again Fibonacci's not the answer to everything in the marketplace even though this is giving you a general rule principle and in theory and it's going to get you very very close to some really sweet setups do not demand that the price reaches to these levels for your targets and what I do and this is how I teach my students as well if this is the fifth level that we're looking for okay in other words if your calculations suggest that this is what the range level for negative one would be on the projection 6510 is the nearest 10 level without getting up to that level so what we're doing is we're rounding down to the next 10 level okay so wherever this level would be say it was 15 it would still be 6510 for me so I'd be looking to take profit for scaling out here if this level was at 15 or more pips this would be my first scaling from my entry down here at 64 50 so 64 50 it was my limit on entry for general principles and the stop would be 64 30 so it's a 20 pip stop and again forget risk three word we're not teaching that don't think it has to be three to one it has to be five to one you know if it's one to one it's still good in my opinion it's good because if you have a setup that repeats over and over and over again very frequently I understand and accept the fact I'm not going to be a winner on every single trade I'm gonna take losses but if I have a system that doesn't require me to spend a lot of money when I'm losing but I do have a high frequency of accuracy and if you look at this you'll determine if this does or doesn't have a lot of accuracy but nonetheless by looking at and studying it with this logic behind it's not the fib that's creating it the logic is we've traded about the previous days high in a relatively bullish scenario so we're lending well on this example for bias but it doesn't require bias if you blow out the previous days high or blow out the previous days low you still look for these general theories to depend out and again it's not about right or wrong you're not supposed to be taking live trades with this I'm not enticing you to take trades with this I'm teaching you how to read the tape how to read the price action and forecast setups that will repeat if you know what you're looking for so first profit here we could take obviously at 93 and 8 pipettes it's 40 plus pips so that definitely will meet the minimum criteria of 15 pips before first scaling and then you can get another scaling out at 65 10 which is rounded down to from the fib level here it can hit this fib level or can go through it a little bit more and that's fine this is where you would take your next level of profit taking if you can get first scaling where it's 15 pips or more you want to start reducing your your risk on your stop to about midpoint of the range that you identified here because if it comes back down into that it's generally not a good idea to hold onto the trade let let it stop you out you've taken something out at partial and then you reduced your risk and then if it comes back down stops you've taken something off the bone you got a bite of flesh and if it comes back down you didn't get stopped at what it lost that's in theory what we're saying here and if we get second scaling if you ever get a second scaling you have to be above your entry point at least two or three pips and just let it go okay so that way you've gotten two pieces of meat off the bone and now you're in a position where your stop should in theory protect you from taking a loss on the remaining balance it does not mean you can't take a loss because you can as long as the trades open you are inviting risk and the market can always get down or above your stop loss and that's this life okay and a lot of people don't realize that they're listening to people online you know my stop's gonna do my job nope not always it's just that's the best case scenario and sometimes the best case scenario doesn't work out so we can see how price eventually makes a run up into 65 10 right there guess it's a nice little opportunity to scale off 10 pips I'm sorry 65 10 which is three and a half pips below where the fib projected to but that does not mean collapse the trade okay it doesn't mean get out of the trade leave a little bit on so the again the assumption is when you're paper trading this or if you're demonstrating it you want to use a lot size that allows you to have multiple in my case I like to look for a leverage that allows me to take three partials and then give me something to let run that means I can get four stages of scaling out of that position not all positions will allow me to do that and here's the thing if it doesn't let me do that I don't take that trade so I've giving you something bonus in here where it helps me determine with a decision based process and protocols that leads to me getting into a trade there's lots of times I see moves coming and I can see them forming I can see exactly when they're gonna turn exactly where they're likely to go but I'm not in them because they don't meet all the criteria that I demand of my setups so there's nothing wrong with being very very dependent on your rules and only executing in that it's actually a good thing it builds discipline it builds maturity as a trader and you will not be shaken by a lot of the things that a trader that doesn't have rule based ideas that sticks to them very rigid will they will generally be encountering a lot more stress anxiety because they're always guessing as to what they should be doing versus this is what I'm doing this is the time and day I'm doing it and I'm looking forward to go long I'm looking forward to go short if it doesn't fit the criteria you don't do anything and you let it go and you'll see over weeks of time doing that you'll in theory protect yourself from taking from taking on more risk than you're supposed to or should and you're gonna be working towards a perception of price action that is going to be appreciated by you and your bottom line and your results will show that but again you're going to take losses you're going to get it wrong this is not a magic recipe for always winning trading okay it's just something to start with it's rule based and you stick with it come heller high water you do this for weeks and you see if it pans out and shows any kind of merit and I promise you if you do this you're going to see it so the market comes up to that 65 10 level has a reaction retraces back down into some older flow and we want to keep something in we want to keep a leader in the water see if we can catch a runner and the fib will hopefully give us another level of importance and if you scrunch it down okay we have 65 52 and 9 pipettes okay so that's the next level which would be this range two times that's one of it here and then the second one here so this is two standard deviations this level in here generally if for day trading if they ever get an explosive move I want to be out at this point here and I'm content with if it runs more I don't care I'm not a long-term position trader and it could continue for six months and everybody can say yeah but you missed this I see I see tea and it's I'm not interested I could care less I want consistency I want continuity and I want the ability to be able to see these things repeat over and over and over again trades okay for a neophyte are mysterious they sneak up on them they surprise them they're like well what just happened you've been noticed that when you get online and you see people on Twitter Instagram whatever okay you know any of these chat room things these these trade rooms they're all of like surprise whoa what happened with the so-and-so and now they're only interested in that pair or that mark because it moved you are not going to be surprised you're going to be anticipating okay you're gonna be anticipating and by anticipating things occurring around a specific time of day around a rule-based idea and a pattern that you're familiar with and seeing over and over again now let's go back to that analogy about buying a car that you have a lot of affinity for it's a sports car or it's a luxury car you like this car you can't imagine being anything else but the driver of that car and you buy it and you bring it home remember generally when you look around very soon after taking a home you will start seeing that car more because you have activated your filter in your your attention to elect to let these cars get your attention okay and that's what you're doing you're teaching yourself to see this pattern over and over and over again in price action and by default what happens is when you start seeing it form live with everything on your chart annotating it the time of day what you're anticipating in terms of direction it's supposed to expand up or down relative to the market being bullish or bear relative to it running the previous days higher low you will see the pattern form live and you'll know what it looks like and you'll trust what you have practiced in hindsight weeks and months of it and now when you watch price action live it'll be like I see it it's right there and you won't be surprised you won't be taken back like wow where did that just come from price is algorithmic it repeats every single day on elements of time and price it does not work on magic Fibonacci the Fibonacci is just a way for me to frame the context the use this pattern okay I didn't reinvent Fibonacci I'm not trying to claim claim the three-quarter pullback of a Fibonacci is mine the logic of using the Fib with time and the element of market structure that's me that's mine that's why it's called optimal trade entry OTE is just an abbreviation of those three words what makes it optimal is it's occurring at a time of day when the market will likely spool and spread out in one particular direction over the other so it's more inclined to go higher or lower relative to the things that I'm showing here all right so anyway so we have two opportunities here for scaling one two and this is the target where you would want to get out at the market trading right now it's just about midpoint of that in here now you can use this midpoint which I don't have a Fib and if you want to add a Fib for that level it would be negative 1.0 and that would give you a line right in here I just don't care to have it in this point where the market is running you want to have your stop loss below some point of support or structure that would yes make your stop be part of a pull of sell-side liquidity or where a bank of sell-stops would be but you have already in theory taken one two portions of profit out and your stop would just be above break even so you want to look at where you are in terms of the current market structure we had to run here it retraced and then rally up multiple terms lower so we retraced multiple times I like the idea of moving the stop below here not below here okay not below here why because this one we already had a run below these lows here and then we broke to new highs we had a retracement to this low and a retracement to this low which is basically the relative equal lows so it could still get below here it could break down hit that and still go higher longer term and I would miss out on that move just trying to choke the trade with a really really tight stop loss which is not advisable so we have this low that's much more appropriate for trailing a stop loss and not jamming it up too tight and not giving the the market room debris especially because we're tracing this on a five minute chart so the idea again is we're looking for day trades and not hold this thing for four weeks not even for multiple days but this is how you would manage your trade so if all this occurred inside of the same trading day or same few hours say it move say all this movement here occurred in a little bit less time the same thing I'm showing you here in terms of when you would move your stop would be the same thing this is we have a reaction and we have two higher reactions you don't want to put your stop loss at the nearest area where stops would be everybody else has their stop loss below this low or here mine would be down here and I already banked two positions or two scaling okay so if it gets 65 50 and nine pipettes you would collapse the entire trade and be done and be content with that so you would be see basically getting around a hundred pips movement from this particular trade with three partials or the final collapse here now if this level was higher up okay so no it's if you weren't getting this range here and it allowed for a hundred pips but a hundred pips occurs before the two standard deviations of the initial range to create your fib so this is your range this is one standard deviation of it here and then another state deviation would be here if this level is above a hundred pips okay in other words if this range here was like 65 62 9 okay that would be a hundred and ten pips from your entry you would take a partial at a hundred pips flat simply just take a hundred pips bank something there as well so there's your rules it's very simple those rules I've given you if you missed it if you weren't really taking notes go back and watch the video again and listen very carefully to give you very specific criteria about when to move a stop what entry price you would look for where your stop loss would be and where you take partials and when you graduate that stop and what you avoid doing when moving a stop not trying to choke the trade out by having a stop loss you know right under here or right under here or because this looks like it's support you know there you put your stop loss there there's a lot of people it's in this pair right now they have cell stops rate below here they may have been lucky they went along here maybe they went in here or they bought here and just wrote it out because they only use a stop loss but now they want to put a stop loss in they're thinking here okay so I use market structure to help me manage a trade and market structure you can learn that it's on my YouTube channel as well but this low here I want to put my stop at this low and not something ultra super tight because just normal gyrations okay or quick sudden retracement lower and it still be viable for the trade going higher would knock you out prematurely and you would miss the opportunity of allowing yourself taking out a hundred pips or where the second standard deviation would be for your ultimate target right so hopefully you guys got something from this I'll try to give you something every single day it will not be this in-depth okay so the rules have been applied and shared with you in this video and I'll always refer back to this video when there's any discussion about when stops removed how you take partials and what the general principle of this pattern is okay it'll be a five minute or less many times that are probably less than four minutes because this is going to be me saying okay here's your chart is it a levels and here's what it looks like and it'll be just all the annotation on the chart and it'll be me saying take care God bless and good luck in trading and with that I'm gonna close this one and do that very thing which good luck in good trading",
