  "full_text": "welcome back to lesson two of short-term trading March 2017 ICT mentorship content this lesson is defining the weekly range profiles okay before we get into this let me preface it by saying this is one of the lessons that if you just look through it quickly and not paying much attention to it it's going to look rather uh ambiguous it's going to seem unfruitful but its impact is shown and solidified really by you going through price data and seeing these profiles unfold in hindsight seeing how they operate how they unfold and the conditions that I'm giving you how they are always generally precursors to them performing so the classic Tuesday low of the week okay this is a market profile that is generally bullish so you're already looking for bullish prices anyway and what you're looking for is manipulation in the form of price hovering above a higher time frame discount array on Monday then drops into a higher time frame discount array on Tuesday to form the low of the week how to anticipate this you have to know the higher time frame discount arrays and when the market fails to drop into that array odds are Tuesday we'll likely see the drive lower Tuesday London open and or New York session okay the next one is the classic Tuesday high of the week this Market profile for the week is generally bearish you're already expecting lower prices and the manipulation You're Expecting is when price is hovering below a higher time frame premium array Monday then Rises into a higher time frame premium array on Tuesday to form the high of the week and you anticipate this forming by knowing the higher time frame premium arrays and when the market fails to rise into that array odds are Tuesday we'll likely see the drive higher Tuesday's London open and or New York session just like the classic Tuesday low of the week well the classic high of the week there can be another run higher to make a higher high in the week for this profile than the highest formed in the London session Tuesday so in other words they can come back and run the London High out and still form this for the classic Tuesday low of the week it can come back and make a lower low in the New York sessions there's one caveat that has to be applied to both of them so have that in your notes okay the next one is the Wednesday low of week this is when you're generally bullish on the marketplace already and the manipulation you're looking for is when price is hovering above a higher time frame discount array Monday and Tuesday then drops into the higher time frame discount array on Wednesday to form the low of the week you anticipate this by knowing the higher time frame discount arrays and when the market fails to drop into that array odds are Wednesday will likely see the drive lower Wednesday's London open and or New York session Monday and Tuesday can also be down days as well to form this profile Wednesday London session low can be ran out on the Wednesday New York session and then it can create the low of the week so be be aware that that can possibly happen as well okay the next one is the Wednesday high of week this profile is generally bearish you're already looking for lower prices and the manipulation You're Expecting is when price is hovering below a higher time frame premium array Monday and Tuesday then Rises into that higher time frame premium array on Wednesday to form the high of the week you anticipate this by knowing the higher time frame premium arrays and when the market fails to rise into that array odds are Wednesday we'll likely see the drive higher Wednesdays long and open and or New York session Monday and Tuesday can be up days as well to form this profile just like we mentioned for Wednesday low of week the London open high on Wednesday can be ran out on Wednesday's New York session and still create the high of the week so have that in your notes okay the next one we have is consolidation Thursday reversal this is a generally bullish Market condition so what you're looking for in manipulation is we're going to be looking for consolidation Monday through Wednesday then price runs the entry week low and rejects it forming a market reversal the key is it's consolidating it's not only going higher or lower Monday through Wednesday okay to anticipate this as you have to know the higher time frame discount to raise and when the market fails to drop into that array odds are Thursday we'll likely see the drive lower Thursday on a market driver news and or rate release late New York session this is typically around the two o'clock Eastern Standard Time or 2 p.m New York time okay consolidation Thursday reversal for a bearish market profile the manipulation you're looking for is consolidation Monday through Wednesday then it runs to enter week high and rejects it forming a market reversal you anticipate this by knowing the higher time frame premium arrays and when the market fails to rise into that array odds are Thursday we'll likely see a drive higher Thursday on a market driver news or rate release late New York session around 2 p.m New York time now just like we saw for the bullish consolidation Thursday reversal this is generally on rate announcements fomc or interest rate uh adjustments okay consolidation midweek rally this is a bullish Market profile already expecting higher prices when you're looking for this the manipulation You're Expecting is the consolidation Monday through Wednesday then runs the inch week high and then expands higher into Friday how to anticipate when the market is bullish and has yet to run to the premium array on the higher time frames it has recently rallied from a discount array and simply paused without any bearish reversal price action indicating price is about to expand higher for the premium array consolidation midweek decline this is a bearish market profile You're Expecting bearish prices and the manipulation you're looking for is when price is consolidating Monday through Wednesday then runs to enter week low and expands lower into Friday you anticipate this profile forming when the market is bearish and has yet to run the discount array on the higher time frames and it has recently declined from a premium array and simply paused without any bullish reversal price action indicating price is about to expand lower for the discount array Seek and Destroy bullish Friday this is a neutral or low probability Market profile the telltale signs the manipulation is taking part in this profile is where price is consolidating Monday through Thursday running shallow stops under and above the entry week highs and lows then runs the intra-week high and expands higher into Friday how to anticipate it when the market is awaiting interest rate announcements and or non-farm payroll can create this profile in the summer months of July and August it's better to avoid trading these conditions altogether Seek and Destroy bearish Friday the profile again is neutral low probability manipulation is seen by Price consolidating Monday through Thursday running shallow stops under and above the entry week highs and lows then runs the intra-week low expands lower into Friday how to anticipate it when the market is awaiting interest rate announcements or non-farm payroll can create this profile in the summer months of July and August it's better again to avoid these conditions Wednesday weekly reversal this Market profile is bullish you're already expecting higher prices you're looking for is where prices consolidating Monday through Tuesday and drives lower into a higher time frame discount array to induce sell stops than strongly reverses how to anticipate this when the market is trading at a long-term or intermediate term low price will pair institutional buying with pending sell site liquidity or traditionally known as a sell stop rate Wednesday weekly reversal profile bearish you aren't expecting lower prices the manipulation You're Expecting is when price is consolidating Monday through Tuesday and it drives higher into a higher time frame premium array to induce buy stops then strongly reverses how to anticipate this when the market is trading at a long term or enemy a term high price will pay our institutional selling with pending buy side liquidity or as otherwise known a buy stop read now it may seem rather simplistic to go through this squiggly line and a few comments but the impact is going to be really appreciated in your understanding when you go through price action with a one hour chart go through any pair any segment of time go back as far as you want okay and I want you to break down price and Define these Moves In what you're seeing in price and then look at the characteristics of what is going on prior to these market profiles forming and you're going to see a recurring theme that generally the characteristics that we have outlined here are precursors to these Market model profiles so hopefully this has been insightful to you we will be giving you more insights about this when we start looking at the market maker templates and we'll be referring back to these as well we use PD arrays and if the data ranges until next lesson wish you good luck in good Trading",
