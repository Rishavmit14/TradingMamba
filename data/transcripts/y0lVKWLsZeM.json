  "full_text": "welcome to lesson five folks short-term trading this teaching is going to be specifically talking about low resistance liquidity runs and consolidations okay we have to preface it by a reminder of every setup that we look to execute on and to stalk into the track if you will is based on time and price and the time element is going to be related to the upto data ranges last 60 days 40 and 20. and we're going to be focusing on premium and discount PD arrays so for short-term Trading we will excel in the range of the last three months so the up to data range of 60 days is our look back period and it's going to comprise every element that we need to frame a short-term trade or one shot one kill now as a reminder when we deal with time and price you price moves from a premium to a discount array or from a discount array to a premium array in between these two Realms of premium and discount price will key off of a time element related to the if the data range so we're blending both time and price an element of the last 20 40 and 60 days to a institutional reference point in the realm of the PD array Matrix okay for our study and case study examples we're going to be looking at the cable or British pound USD and this is a daily chart and what we do is we Define a market whether that it's it's trending or it's in consolidation and obviously anyone with the average intelligence in terms of market analysis they can tell looking at the British pound we have been in a consolidation Mark it's not been in a trending Mark it's been in consolidation so whenever we see a market that's range bound or it's cannot move outside of the current trading range that you're looking at at any given time on a daily chart you're looking at a frame of about three months again you'll come back three months or 60 trading days which is the relative if the data range that we use for maximum definition of look back so when we have this framework in terms of the last 60 days what we do is we have to define the range in terms of a high and a low now what we do is we Define the range in the form of its highest and lowest Candlestick body we're not concerned about the Wix so much but we're primarily looking at the bodies of the candles so I have here the lowest and the highest in terms of the candlesticks bodies and you can see those reference points here but the arrows and that's going to be our range that we're going to be framing all of our analysis Concepts as it relates to one shot one kill okay so what we'll have to do is we have to look at the market in this range and we can use a tool that's on every platform it's the Fibonacci so we're going to use our FIB tool to determine the 50 of the range and we're going to note that range midpoint so I'm dragging the Fib from the highest body candle to the lowest body candle in other words I'm not using the lowest Wick low in the highest Wick High I'm looking for the highest body on the candles either it's an open or closed I don't care which one it is but whatever highest form of high open or close that's the one I'm looking for in the last 60 trading days and I'm looking for the lowest open or close in the last 60 trading days that gives me my defined range in terms of consolidation then I note the 50 level and I draw a horizontal line on my daily chart next we have to determine the 50 levels of the upper and lower ranges anything above the 50 level that's going to be our area which we look for cell scenarios either by taking profit on Longs or short positions and anything in the lower portion we're looking for Longs or covering short positions now the upper portion of the range from the highest body close or open to the midpoint that we Define by the total consolidation range we measure that with the FIB as well and I gave you two examples of where you could draw the anchor points with your FIB with the arrows and you note the 50 level on your fib and you drop a horizontal line there by noting this we've now noted the upper range for the total consolidation range next we do the same thing by noting the 50 level of the lower range between the midpoint of the total consolidation range to the lowest body close or open noting it's 50 level as well on the FIB and I drop a horizontal line on that now what we have here is by defining our consolidation range in this manner it gives us a form of premium and discount identification anything above the midpoint or mean 50 level or in this case the gray that would be deemed as a premium range and anything below it would be deemed as a discount range next we identify the PD arrays in each new range now I'm going to save this a lot of time and just apply everything from a monthly a weekly and daily okay so now you can see all of the if the data ranges and from a form of a premium and discount have been applied to the chart now I want you to look at this for a moment before we go to the next slide so pause the video here and really study what's been identified so every premium and discount array provides setups in the overall PD array Matrix so what we're looking for is a element of time and price to blend a setup for a buy or a cell we understand that the highest probability trades for shorts is by looking for any PD array in the premium range of this consolidation so anything above the midpoint of the 50 level or the gray level here that's going to be ideal cell scenarios if it is coupled with a PD array for a premium Market we are blending both time and price we would look for that move to be correlated to a later discount PD array when price moves that down to either the 50 level of the total consolidation or any level below the midpoint or 50 level of the consolidation an example would be the fair value Gap and bearish Order block in the premium level around the February time period of 2017. and pairing that with a weekly bullish order blocking threshold in a discount in March of 2017. now when we look at their quadrants like this where it's been broken up into a premium and discount we can also further Define those quadrants into their own respective or unique premium and discount trading range and what do I mean by that well let's take a closer look as you can see here the lower quadrant can be divided into equal halves as well and that in itself can be viewed from a premium and discount format when we see these elements here anything that forms as a discount PD array in a discount range from this view or perspective this is going to be high probability short covering objectives or it's going to be high probability new long positions and any first profit would be best taken on a loan once it enters the premium range of this uh PD array Matrix again moving up the same thing can be applied to the new quadrants that's shown here ideal Longs are entered at the discount level or in that discount range and taking first profit would have to be best applied by taking your uh first long exit in the premium range of this PD array Matrix now what you're looking at is a daily chart so in the form of a four hour or one hour you'll see that there's going to be premium PD arrays in those lower four hour and one hour time frames that you could pair up first objectives for targets I'm giving you the elements to look at through the scope of a daily chart and I'm finally we can apply it to this area as well each path is further divided into new halves but we're looking at it in the form of an algorithmic way of defining premium and discount so when markets are creating discounts like this again this discount range it's shown here they're high probability Longs and again a four hour or one hour premium PD array as defined here you can't see them in the daily but you would drop down into a lower time frame four hour and one hour to take first profit on your Longs that you used to get entries on by buying in the discount area now we're above the midpoint of the total consolidation range so now even though we're above it and technically in a overall premium Market we can still take Longs but it has to be defined in the scope as we're showing here we have the overall consolidation we divide it in half then we divide those halves into halves as well so we have quadrants then those quadrants are divided in half as well as we're showing here in incremental increases moving further up the overall consolidation range by buying in the discount range and again taking first profit in a lower four hour one hour premium range coupled with a PD array that's premium based in other words if we were buying for instance the bullish order block mean threshold here and a discount now overall we're in a premium Market but this is still a possible long entry because we're in a lower portion of that total larger premium range so we still have room to reach for higher premium PD arrays and obviously we have rings that reach for much higher objectives so looking at it like this framing it what would otherwise be deemed as overbought we don't view it like that this is why indicators do not work from a algorithmic perspective looking at price ranges like this it gives us a greater definition on how we can frame entries and classify them as oversold or undervalued entries for Longs or overvalued or overbought entries for shorts in this case we could take a example of the daily bullish order block mean threshold we could be buying there and then once price trades up into the premium range we could look for a four hour or one hour premium PDA rate the couple and exit with and moving further up the consolidation range we have a new discount and premium PD array Matrix and we could Define this as well and what we're doing is we're coupling the range as defined by premium and discount with actual PD array in the form of fair value gaps Bears order blocks weekly rejection blocks all those things to the left of our chart we're looking back that 20 40 and 60 trading days for the ipta data range so we're blending both time and price in the in the form of premium and discount so we're blending the elements of time and price we're looking at the market in the scope of overbought oversold but not in the context of an indicator we're looking at it algorithmically in the scope of quadrants that are broken down into premium and discount and by itself it doesn't mean anything but when price trades down to a PD array whether it be a discount or a premium if we trade into that element whether it be a bullish order block a breaker any of those things from the pdra Matrix that we've taught you if you're looking for a long the highest probable entries for Longs again are entering in the discount range and coupling it with a premium range PD array it doesn't matter that we're in a premium range of the overall consolidation because price can move back and forth and oscillate from the highest portion and many times make a slightly higher high and return back inside of the range and it can go to the lowest low move outside the range a little bit and come right back in the middle range as well so we're anticipating the isolation effect of price while it's in consolidation but in that consolidation there's smaller consolidations so we're able to look at price in the view of overbought never sold without the element of indicators or relying on mathematically derived number crunching lines what we're looking for is range defined in the overall context of the consolidation as we've had here we're in a the upper half of the portion of the larger consolidation and by itself that would many times filter out buy signals from anyone else that would look for over about a result but for us we can frame this with the oversold condition even in the element of a premium Market it's a discount Market in a overall premium Market that still has room to go up that's basically in other words a Layman's way of approaching a definition but whatever we do in terms of Entry or exits we're looking for elements to frame the discount PD arrays that means bullish order blocks Breakers fair value gaps below us in price trading below an old low to take out cell stops we're using those ideas to frame long positions and then taking first profits at a four hour one hour basis once it enters the premium PD array Matrix range and finally at the top of the larger consolidation we can see that there is still an opportunity where one could be a buyer but the opportunities fall off precipitously in terms of probabilities and you can see now that the premium array area in other words for PD array Matrix bare shorter blocks old highs bearish Breakers bearish mitigation blocks all those ideas they're going to be much more influential in terms of price action and you'll see much more Dynamic price action from that side of the spectrum and you can see that in the form of the weekly rejection block prices traded from in March of 2017 we saw also a move away from the fair value Gap and bearish Order block again and it's largely hinged on the fact that we are in an upper portion of the overall consolidation and we made it up into that last smallest portion of the premium Market or premium PD array Matrix the Shaded area that says premium that's the highest portion or last little segment of price in this consolidation so anytime price reaches up into that it's going to have a much more impactful response in price when it trades to a bearish PD array or a premium PD array so we see that happening with the weekly rejection block it also took out an old high formed in February so there's many instances there where you can see why price had a strong rejection also King off of that last midpoint that's dividing the premium and discount levels noted here we had a really significant sell-off and it trades all the way back down into a daily bullish order block mean threshold then we had a 100 pip move that we called for in our day-to-day meetings and charts and you see the response it trades right back up to what the daily bearish order block and it also overlaps with the premium 50 level so there's a lot of things that you need to be able to look at conceptually and you have to do it on your own time I could give you a plethora of examples over and over and over again but this is one teaching that I've given you enough that if you break your charts down and do your own study yes this is the part that requires your work this takes study time it takes you uh wanting to be in the charts looking for it because I'm not going to be there when we separate you're going to have to do these things on your own you have to find these these opportunities on your own but by having this element what we're doing is we're looking for low resistance liquidity runs from one PD array to another from a discount to a premium but we're coupling it with looking back over the last three months because one shot one kill uses and excels inside the last three months of trading so when we look back at the last 20 the last 40 in the last 60 trading days it gives us framework to say okay where is the premium PD array Matrix leading me to in terms of what I can sell to and what I can reach for for Longs the couple my exits with or where are my discount pdra Matrix and where are those levels I can cover my shorts at and I'm going to look back over the last 20 40 and 60 days to pair those things up I'm also now applying ranges in terms of the PD array Matrix whether it be a premium or discount market so it allows me to build context of what I'm looking for as an entry and how I can look for my first objective in targeting now in an Ideal World the best buys are going to be in the lower portion or lower half of the overall consolidation and in the lower quadrant in other words the discount Matrix and the highest probability trades for selling short or taking long exits are going to be in the premium range divided by the upper portion so in other words that last quadrant that's going to be your best cells the highest probability cells or highest probability uh exits for lungs that's going to be your best scenario that's where the algorithm is going to reach for for selling or exiting on longs and any long position in here again you have to take it with a grain of salt you have to know the overall range you're in because just because you see a train to a down candle you have to have I understand that it has a room to go up and in this case you can see what the daily bullish order block mean threshold that 100 pip rally was a response off of yes a PDA rate discount bull shoulder block but it trades up to a daily bearish order block but it trades up into that bearish order block once it gets into the premium range that also gives us a high probability Target now yes it's one shot one kill scenario and we're trying to trade the weekly range but one shot one kill is not defined by getting in on a Monday and getting out on Friday one shot one kill is a couple days of trading it's short-term trading it can be as little as one day and as long as a week and finally when we look at the range in the middle this can be the areas of where you're going to get chopped up the most because if you're looking at a range incorrectly if you've already defined the range and you're looking at PDA rate of premium and discount that have already been traded to in order to look at a down candle in a discount Market normally that may be a bullish order block but if it's already been traded to the likelihood of it being a bullish order block with high probability falls off because it's already been used we want to use a new PD array in a discount or premium Market that has not been traded to because the algorithm knows price has been there once before so it's going to seek new liquidity and expand to allow the banks to take participation in a move higher or lower so looking at the Rings like this as we defined it if you're trading in the middle of the range like this and you're not strong in your directional bias or where the market May reach for next in other words understanding where open float is where is the buy stops and the sell stops if you're not really strong with that if you're trading in this range here you're going to get chopped up a lot over time you'll learn how to better approach these specific premium discount ranges but when you look at the outer rim when we are just showing the previous slide the higher you can get up and the overall consolidation in a premium Market the better your short positions are going to be and the easier it's going to be to reach for a profitable discount PD array the lower you are in the total consolidation the better your discount long entries are going to be and it's easier for you to get to a profitable premium PD array blending the two time and price working in a Range environment like this gives you context and you can find very easy low resistance liquidity runs between one PD array to another and understanding the element of time and price",
