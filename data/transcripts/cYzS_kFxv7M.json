  "full_text": "hello folks this is episode number 14 in a continuing series of 20 videos for the optimal trade entry pattern recognition series for the inner circle trader YouTube channel alright so our example for today is the British Pound we already have our chart trained in on the five-minute chart and you know the drill pause your video study it before I show the annotations okay here we go we have our New York session again always 8:30 to 11:00 a.m. New York time and this is our optimal trade entry now I'm gonna go over a couple in here briefly but this is the one that I would use this is how I teach it and my mentorship as well the selection of this particular swing is again it's a little bit of a finesse type thing but I want you to now you see this here I'm going to take it off for a moment so you can see when you're looking at your chart it's gonna look like this unless you have other things overtop of it that's why you don't wanna have any caters you don't want to have trend lines moving averages none of that stuff okay because it's gonna be a distraction you want to be looking at the time of 8:30 to 11:00 and when the markets showing a strong willingness to go lower now this is obvious a reverse one if you look at my Twitter account today I actually show a recording of me highlighting this turning point here on the British Pound at this order block and running up above a level which it does here I was given that as an indication to study that and it was highlighting this movement here creating a Judas swing and then ultimately break down when we entered the 8:30 to 11:00 a.m. New York time that's our New York session time of day for this model of Korea for YouTube and what you're looking for is a a price swing that's very clear that has a clear indication that it's trying to drive lower okay in other words there's a a very quick like underlying pressure for the price to go lower it's a lot of back-and-forth in price action that creates that little trading range of square block area here this notice the difference between all these down close candles versus this in here it's a little muddy okay in other words it's not as clear yes it does decline but it just seems like it's a lot more unser in this area whereas if we have this swing high we have this lower high lower high to the right in this one single candle here that to me with this real clear indication I want to move lower that's the price leg that I'm going to elect to use and if you go back and look at all the examples we've been doing in this series they all have very similar characteristics to this very thing here so it's not a matter of going back in and cherry picking which one looks better which one looks perfect whatever after you do this for months you're gonna see it it's the same signature all the time and now what is a signature a signature is something or a characteristic okay that the markets give us as price action traders that we're looking for to repeat over and over again so if there's something to a market that creates a certain phenomenon it should have a lot of reoccurring instances of a guess so what I'm teaching in this series is the repeated nature of this particular pattern all you need to do is determine whether you're gonna be trading a run below yesterday's low or above yesterday's high and I've already shown you a continuation pattern using the same thing with a market that's already gone beyond the previous day's high or low and you can still use this this model to practice and grow when your understanding with price action so with that said all of this in here is the price leg that I would use and how I teach it so it's very clear it's showing a displacement okay very clear obvious movement lower the market comes back up trades into this high but not all up into it so we're add the feed back to it again and again the fib is not de magic it's not trust me it has nothing to do with why prices going up err the fib is just allowing me to frame a market that is really overbought without having to use any overbought or oversold indicator because I'm showing you the range of this high to this low so when price traded back up to here if we look back inside that range we are really near this high so technically that would be a short-term overbought market that's all the fibs helping me illustrate and then the fibonacci projections okay all these levels on here are just rough ideas how far the market could go but again we're linking that with the previous day's low in this case here and then you see the previous day's low we do trade down into it now the details are we always look for the 62 percent retracement level that in this instance would be a hypothetical entry of one point two two six eight when one pit bet using a 20 pips top loss that would take us above this high no real jeopardy in terms of being stopped out you do have 7 pips drawdown again we're always using a 62 percent trace malevolent as your entry and try to use 2 70.5 level or the 79% tracin level but as I mentioned in previous recordings in this series you're likely to miss the trade and/or the dealer spread may not be covered for your entry to fill so again we're using the low-hanging fruit approach as I like to teach in my mentorship where it's really really easy to get to 62% traitement level and not always 279 everybody wants to sell at the highest levels that way their stop-loss could be smaller but you don't need to do that and especially when you're learning how to use the pattern so the market starts to show a willingness to drop lower rate down here we have about 20 pips or so at just the old low so right away you can Bank something there and at 1/2 of a standard deviation you have about 40 pips that you could potentially bank there hypothetically and then ultimately down to 60 pips which runs the previous day's low so overall we have a three-to-one reward to risk if you'd like to look at those types of things I think it's really not necessary because if you have a high strike rate method or model and I know some of you that are learning or maybe some of you that really like to look at these types of things and say this is what has to happen for me to take a trade you know you can make a amazing career trading one to one if you have a very solid strike rate and clearly as I'm indicating in these examples here this pattern works every single day it's there every single day and the problem that's gonna plague you is determining whether you want to be a buyer or seller and I know what you want to ask me if we were in a chat room together okay or if you were talking to me directly through Twitter or or if you emailed me because I get this email a lot can you just tell me how determined the bias and I'm telling you again it's always the same response no one it takes a lot of other supporting lessons to get good at the bias now I could tell you things and I've done a lot of that even in free tutorials that's on this YouTube channel but it takes you getting in here and studying every single day screen capturing your charts and doing the annotations yourself and getting used to what the pattern looks like and it sounds like it should be just tell me how to do it one time and it works all the time it's not like that because if it was just that easy believe me everybody we got here doing it and they just don't do it so this sense one more example in the continuing series hopefully you found it insightful until next time wish you good luck and good
