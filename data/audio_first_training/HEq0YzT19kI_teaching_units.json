Secondly, candle body must close below the valid pullback in sweeping swings, then we will market as our chalk point. In sweep based model, we do not wait for inducement level. We can enter anytime when price will give us a pullback to this high. I repeat, in sweep based model, we do not wait for inducement after this chalk point. We can directly enter here after candle closing, or we can wait for a minor pullback for better risk to reward.",
