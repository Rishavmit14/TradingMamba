      "llm_summary": "## Definition\nThe Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) is ICT's signature entry model based on Fibonacci retracement levels applied to a price swing. It identifies the highest-probability entry zone where institutional order flow is likely to support a continuation of the prevailing trend.\n\n## Rules\n1. **Identify the swing**: Locate a clear swing low to swing high (for longs) or swing high to swing low (for shorts) on the timeframe you are trading\n2. **Apply Fibonacci tool**: Draw from the swing low to swing high for bullish setups, showing retracement levels\n3. **OTE Zone**: The optimal entry zone lies between the 62% and 79% retracement levels - this is where smart money accumulates positions\n4. **Time of day matters**: Trade during the New York session (8:30 AM - 11:00 AM EST) for highest probability setups\n5. **Confluence with PD Arrays**: OTE should align with other Premium/Discount arrays like order blocks or fair value gaps\n\n## Identification\n- Look for price to retrace into the 62%-79% zone after a displacement move\n- The entry candle should show rejection from this zone (wick into the zone, close outside)\n- In this video example: USD/CAD 5-minute chart, entry at 62% level (1.39032) during New York session\n- Previous day's high/low acts as the draw on liquidity - price runs above Wednesday's daily high before retracing\n\n## Trading Application\n- Entry: Place limit order at the 62% retracement level or wait for price to tap and reject\n- Stop Loss: Below the swing low (for longs) or above swing high (for shorts) - typically 10-15 pips depending on the pair\n- Take Profit: Use standard deviation levels - 1 SD, 1.5 SD, 2 SD extensions from the OTE\n- Risk:Reward demonstrated in this video was 4:1 with a 47-pip opportunity",

ICT uses specific levels (62%, 70.5%, 79%) as the core of the OTE model.\n\n## Rules\n1. **Draw correctly**: Always draw from swing low to swing high for bullish setups (opposite for bearish)\n2. **Key ICT levels**: 0% (swing low), 50%, 62%, 70.5%, 79%, 100% (swing high), and extensions (-0.5, -1, -1.5, -2)\n3. **62% is optimal**: The 62% level is ICT's preferred entry point - it offers best risk:reward\n4. **79% is maximum**: Entries beyond 79% suggest the setup may be failing\n\n## Identification\n- In this video: Fibonacci drawn from the swing low to swing high on USD/CAD 5-minute\n- Entry shown at 62% retracement level at price 1.39032\n- Standard deviation targets shown: +20 pips at 1.5 SD, +30 pips at 1 SD, +40 pips at 0.5 SD, +50 pips at -2 (full extension)\n\n## Trading Application\n- Use Fibonacci tool on TradingView or MT4 with ICT's custom levels\n- Enter at 62% for optimal risk:reward\n- Stop below the swing point (100% level)\n- Target the standard deviation extensions above the swing high",

Institutional traders use these levels to engineer liquidity before reversing price.\n\n## Rules\n1. **Mark daily levels**: At the start of each trading day, mark the prior day's high and low\n2. **Liquidity pools**: Stop losses from retail traders cluster above PDH (for shorts) and below PDL (for longs)\n3. **Run and reverse**: Price often runs these levels to trigger stops before reversing\n4. **Time window**: These runs typically occur during the New York session kill zone\n\n## Identification\n- In this video: Wednesday's Daily High is marked as the key level\n- Price runs above the PDH during New York session to grab buy-side liquidity\n- After the liquidity sweep, price retraces creating the OTE opportunity\n\n## Trading Application\n- Wait for price to run the PDH/PDL during the kill zone\n- Look for OTE setup forming after the liquidity grab\n- Target: Opposite day's level or standard deviation extensions",
