When we entered the 8.30 to 11 a.m. New York time, that's our New York session time of day for this model created for YouTube. And what you're looking for is a price swing that's very clear, that has a clear indication that it's trying to drive lower. In other words, there's a very quick underlying pressure for the price to go lower. It's a lot of back and forth in price action that creates that little trading range here, that little square block area here. This, notice the difference between all of these down close candles versus this in here. It's a little muddy. In other words, it's not as clear.

And I know some of you that are learning or maybe some of you that really like to look at these types of things and say this is what has to happen for me to take a trade. You can make an amazing career trading one-to-one if you have a very solid strike rate. And clearly as I'm indicating in these examples here, this pattern works every single day. It's there every single day.",
