The concept is based on identifying support levels and using annotations on the chart to pinpoint the optimal entry. The trader recommends trading in the pattern when the market is going down and taking sell-side liquidity, which can lead to beautiful results. The key price levels to look for are \"2.50\" and \"3.00,\" and the chart should be analyzed daily to identify the most recent optimal trade entry.",

To spot liquidity on a chart, look for price fluctuations and price levels, such as high, low, and midpoint. ICT recommends trading patterns where liquidity is seeking above or below the midpoint, as this can lead to beautiful results. Key price levels to consider are around 1.3782, 1.3784, and 1.3780. The chart patterns identified are those where liquidity seeks above or below the midpoint, and the annotations highlight these price fluctuations and levels. The liquidity concept is important for traders to identify opportunities to trade, and the chart analysis provides insights into the specific patterns and visual characteristics that can be used to identify liquidity.",

These blocks are typically used to indicate the price at which a specific order is placed, and they can be used to identify potential support or resistance levels. The optimal trade entry, based on the teaching, is a specific price level labeled \"Optimal Trade Entry.\" ICT recommends trading this pattern by identifying potential support or resistance levels, and then entering the trade when the price reaches these levels. The key price levels to consider are the optimal trade entry and the levels of support or resistance. The chart patterns and visual characteristics of order blocks are important in identifying and trading this specific trading pattern.",

      "llm_summary": "### Higher Highs in the ICT Methodology\n\n#### Definition\nHigher highs refer to specific price points on a chart where the price has reached a higher high. These points are significant in identifying potential support or resistance levels.\n\n#### Identification\nHigher highs are identified by the presence of annotations or markings on the chart, such as price levels and candlestick patterns. The annotations include price levels, such as 0.705, 0.62, and 0.5, which are important support or resistance levels. The annotations also include candlestick patterns, such as the one highlighted in green, which are used to identify specific price points.\n\n#### Trading Application\nICT recommends trading higher highs by identifying the short-term high, which is the price level at which the stock would have to be above to be considered a potential entry point. The short-term low trades to 38.11 and a half, giving you about 20 pips or so. The annotations and markings on the chart support the identification of these price points, which are crucial for making informed trading decisions.\n\n#### Key Price Levels\nThe annotations and markings on the chart highlight important price levels, such as 0.705, 0.62, and 0.5, which are significant support or resistance levels. These levels are crucial for identifying potential entry points and determining the direction of the price trend.\n\n#### Conclusion\nHigher highs are a key concept in the ICT methodology, used to identify significant price points on a chart. The annotations and markings on the chart support the identification of these price points, which are crucial for making informed trading decisions. The annotations highlight important support and resistance levels, which are used to identify potential entry points and determine the direction of the price trend.",
