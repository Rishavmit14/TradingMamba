    "optimal trade entry": {
      "llm_summary": "## Definition\nThe Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) is ICT's precision entry technique that identifies the most favorable retracement level within a price swing for entering trades. It combines Fibonacci retracement levels (62%, 70.5%, 79%) with market structure analysis to pinpoint high-probability entries with tight stop losses.\n\n## Rules\n1. Identify the short-term high and short-term low that defines the swing structure\n2. For sell setups: apply Fibonacci from swing low to swing high; entry zone is 62-79% retracement\n3. For buy setups: apply Fibonacci from swing high to swing low; entry zone is 62-79% retracement\n4. The 70.5% level (0.705) is the sweet spot - the optimal entry within the OTE zone\n5. Stop loss goes above the 100% level (swing high for sells) or below 100% (swing low for buys)\n6. Use standard deviation projections for profit targets (-0.5, -1, -1.5 from swing origin)\n7. Execute entries during high-probability time windows (New York session kill zone)\n\n## Identification\n- Look for a clear swing structure with defined short-term high and low\n- This video shows USDCAD 5-minute chart during New York Session\n- Frame at 120s shows OTE levels marked: 0.62 at 1.38338, 0.705 at 1.38369, 0.79 at 1.38475\n- Entry taken at OTE zone expecting move down to standard deviation targets\n- The swing from 1.38475 high to 1.38115 low defines the structure\n- Video demonstrates a sell trade with targets at -0.5 SD (1.37935), -1 SD (1.37755), -1.5 SD (1.37575)",

    "equal lows": {
      "llm_summary": "## Definition\nEqual Lows are two or more swing lows that rest at approximately the same price level, creating an obvious visual pattern on the chart. In ICT methodology, equal lows represent sell side liquidity pools where retail traders place their stop losses, making them targets for smart money to raid.\n\n## Rules\n1. Equal lows form when price tests a level multiple times and bounces, creating a double or triple bottom pattern\n2. Retail traders see equal lows as strong support - they place buy orders and stops below\n3. Smart money views equal lows as liquidity pools to be targeted and swept\n4. The more equal (cleaner) the lows, the more obvious the liquidity pool\n5. Expect price to sweep below equal lows before reversing higher\n6. Once equal lows are swept, look for buy setups targeting the opposite liquidity\n\n## Identification\n- Scan for two or more swing lows at nearly identical price levels\n- The lows don't need to be perfectly equal - similar levels create the pattern\n- This video demonstrates USDCAD with equal lows acting as sell side liquidity target\n- After sweeping the equal lows, price reverses and creates an OTE sell opportunity\n- The equal lows provide the draw on liquidity that establishes directional bias",

    "sell side liquidity": {
      "llm_summary": "## Definition\nSell Side Liquidity refers to the pool of resting buy orders that accumulate below swing lows, equal lows, and obvious support levels. These orders include stop losses from long positions and buy limit orders from traders expecting support to hold. Smart money targets these liquidity pools to fill large sell orders.\n\n## Rules\n1. Sell side liquidity exists below every swing low - the more obvious, the larger the pool\n2. Stop hunts are engineered moves designed to sweep sell side liquidity\n3. After sell side liquidity is taken, expect price to reverse higher (liquidity has been consumed)\n4. The sweep below sell side liquidity often creates the swing low for a new OTE setup\n5. Seek sell side liquidity when looking for buy setups - price needs to grab liquidity before reversing\n6. Multiple levels of sell side liquidity can exist - price may sweep one and continue to the next\n\n## Identification\n- Mark all obvious swing lows on your chart\n- Equal lows and trendline support represent concentrated sell side liquidity\n- In this video, USDCAD demonstrates price seeking sell side liquidity below equal lows\n- The 5-minute chart shows price sweeping below the obvious low before reversing\n- This liquidity sweep creates the ideal environment for an OTE sell setup",

    "short term high": {
      "llm_summary": "## Definition\nShort Term High (STH) is a swing high on a lower timeframe that defines the upper boundary of the current price swing. In ICT methodology, the short term high is crucial for establishing the swing structure used to calculate OTE levels and set stop loss placement for sell trades.\n\n## Rules\n1. The short term high is the most recent significant swing high on the execution timeframe\n2. For sell trades, the short term high represents the 100% level (top) of the Fibonacci measurement\n3. Stop loss for sell trades goes above the short term high\n4. Breaking above the short term high invalidates the bearish setup\n5. The short term high creates buy side liquidity that may be raided before price moves lower\n6. A valid short term high should have clear structure - not just any micro high\n\n## Identification\n- On a 5-minute or 15-minute chart, look for the most recent swing high with clear rejection\n- The candle(s) forming the short term high should show clear reversal character\n- In this video, the USDCAD 5-minute chart shows short term high at 1.38475\n- This level serves as the 100% mark for the Fibonacci OTE tool\n- Video demonstrates stop loss placement just above this short term high level",

    "new york session": {
      "llm_summary": "## Definition\nThe New York Session is the trading period when New York financial markets are open, representing the highest volume and most volatile period for forex trading, especially for USD pairs. ICT identifies this session (particularly 8:30 AM - 11:00 AM EST) as the kill zone for optimal trade execution.\n\n## Rules\n1. New York Session Kill Zone: 8:30 AM - 11:00 AM EST is the highest probability window\n2. Major economic news releases occur at 8:30 AM EST - expect volatility\n3. The New York Session often sets the high or low of the day\n4. OTE setups during NY session have higher probability due to increased volatility\n5. London Close (12:00 PM EST) can also provide tradeable setups\n6. Avoid trading during low-volatility periods between London Close and NY session\n\n## Identification\n- Mark 8:30 AM - 11:00 AM EST on your chart platform\n- Use session highlighting tools to visualize the NY kill zone\n- In this video, USDCAD 5-minute chart has 'New York Session' label marked\n- The OTE setup and entry occur within this high-probability window\n- Frame at 120s shows entry taken during NY Session (around 10:00 AM EST on May 26, 2020)\n- The video demonstrates how NY Session volatility enables the trade to reach standard deviation targets",

Unlike traditional Fibonacci trading, ICT focuses on the 62%, 70.5%, and 79% retracement levels for entries, and standard deviation projections for targets.\n\n## Rules\n1. 62% (0.62) retracement - bottom of the OTE zone, first level to watch for reaction\n2. 70.5% (0.705) retracement - the sweet spot, optimal entry level within OTE zone\n3. 79% (0.79) retracement - top of the OTE zone, last valid entry level\n4. 100% level - the swing extreme, stop loss placement zone\n5. 0% level - the swing origin, used for standard deviation calculations\n6. Negative extensions (-0.5, -1, -1.5, -2) project profit targets\n\n## Identification\n- Apply Fibonacci tool from swing origin (0%) to swing terminus (100%)\n- For sell setups: 0% at swing low, 100% at swing high\n- For buy setups: 0% at swing high, 100% at swing low\n- In this video, USDCAD shows clear Fibonacci levels:\n  - 0 (origin): 1.38115\n  - 0.62: 1.38338\n  - 0.705: 1.38369\n  - 0.79: 1.38475 (also the 100% swing high)\n  - Extension targets: -0.5 at 1.37935, -1 at 1.37755, -1.5 at 1.37575\n- These levels define the OTE entry zone and profit objectives",
