Reason is our banking system, because our bank works 5 days within a week. As Saturday and Sunday is off day for banks and big institutions, that's why Saturday and Sunday are off trading days in forex. It's mean forex market is off on Saturday and Sunday. Well, to understand the concept and working principle of forex industry, we must start with small banks. Every country or region has small banks operating there. These small banks are bound to share data of each and every transaction to their state bank. They enter this data in system as a digital record. Suppose this is schematic illustration for Asian countries. Similarly, if we talk about London region, these small banks report all transactions data to their big banks or you can say that their state bank. Same goes for New York region and Sydney continent.",
