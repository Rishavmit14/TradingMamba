Because if you do not understand the institutional order flow, then order block theory will be incomplete without it. Well, institutional order flow in forex trading refers to the large volume of trades, executed by institutional traders in the forex market. Big institutions mean banks, hedge funds and insurance companies. Remember, order flow helps us in defining market trend. Well, these are some simple schematic diagrams to understand this flow. Here this is a bearish order flow. Because big institutions are executing large volumes in sell side. Similarly, this chart pattern indicates the bullish order flow.

Well, if this is an ideal order block, then price candle body, I repeat again candle body, the retracing candles body do not close more than 50% of this block. Generally, order block aligned with monthly trend will be high probability on all time frames. For bullish trend, order blocks below IDM levels will be high probability.
