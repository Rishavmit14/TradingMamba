      "llm_summary": "### Price Delivery Cycle\n\n#### Definition\nThe Price Delivery Cycle is the fundamental framework describing how price is delivered in the forex market. It consists of four core elements that operate in a cyclical, repeating pattern: Consolidation (Range), Expansion (Break of Structure), Retracement (Pullback/Correction), and Reversal (Change of Character / CHoCH). These four elements are the pillars of all price movement, and price always moves through this cycle in a natural process.\n\n#### Identification\nTo identify where the market is within the price delivery cycle, traders must recognize which of the four states price is currently in:\n- **Consolidation**: Price is moving sideways in a defined range between two levels (what retail traders call support and resistance). There is no clear trend.\n- **Expansion**: Price moves quickly and aggressively out of a consolidation zone, indicating smart money entry. This aligns with Break of Structure (BOS).\n- **Retracement**: A pullback occurs after expansion, where price retraces to fill imbalance zones and liquidity voids created during expansion.\n- **Reversal**: A Change of Character (CHoCH) occurs where the direction of the price trend changes completely, typically triggered after market grabs a large liquidity pool.\n\nThe cycle is visualized as a four-node diagram: Consolidation -> Expansion -> Retracement -> Reversal -> back to Consolidation.\n\n#### Trading Application\nThe price delivery cycle is the foundation for anticipating what comes next in the market. After identifying the current state, traders can predict the next probable state. Consolidation is the beginning of everything in the price cycle. After consolidation, expect expansion. After expansion, expect retracement or consolidation. After retracement, expect expansion or reversal. After reversal, expect consolidation or retracement. This cycle repeats indefinitely on all timeframes. The cycle applies to all forex pairs and timeframes, forming the basis for designing entry setups within the broader ICT methodology covering price theory, macro analysis, intermarket analysis, and price-and-time theory.",

      "llm_summary": "### Consolidation\n\n#### Definition\nConsolidation is an area where price creates a range between two points, moving within a defined range. It indicates the lack of a clear trend in a particular trading range. In retail terminology, the upper level is called resistance and the lower level is called support, though from an ICT perspective these are liquidity levels. Consolidation is also referred to as a ranging market or trading range.\n\n#### Identification\nConsolidation is identified on a chart by recognizing a sideways price pattern where price oscillates between a defined upper boundary and lower boundary. On a candlestick chart, it appears as a series of candles contained within a horizontal channel. The schematic diagram shows price bouncing between resistance (upper line) and support (lower line) with no directional bias. The range is clearly defined with visible highs and lows that respect these horizontal levels.\n\n#### Importance\nConsolidation is the starting point of the entire price delivery cycle. It serves as the process of making something stronger because it creates liquidity. Breakout traders set their pending orders on both sides of the consolidation range (above resistance and below support). These pending orders create liquidity pools. The higher the number of orders, the higher the liquidity. When there is a bigger liquidity pool, the market will grab it to make a bigger move. This is why a significant price move can be expected after a consolidation phase.\n\n#### Trading Application\nTraders should recognize consolidation as a setup phase rather than a trading phase. It signals that a large move (expansion) is likely to follow. The key is to wait for the consolidation to complete and identify the liquidity grab (manipulation) that typically precedes expansion. Consolidation is the beginning of the price cycle, and recognizing it allows traders to prepare for the expansion phase where entry opportunities arise.",

    "expansion": {
      "llm_summary": "### Expansion\n\n#### Definition\nExpansion is a sign of trend continuation and corresponds to a Break of Structure (BOS). It occurs when price moves quickly and aggressively after a consolidation phase, in the form of speed or displacement. Expansion represents the phase where smart money has entered the market and pushed price directionally with force.\n\n#### Identification\nExpansion is identified by rapid, one-directional price movement following a period of consolidation. On a candlestick chart, it appears as a series of strong, large-bodied candles moving in one direction with minimal wicks on the opposing side. The price breaks out of the consolidation range with momentum. Before the expansion, there is typically a liquidity grab or manipulation move where price briefly moves against the eventual expansion direction to sweep liquidity on one side of the range.\n\n#### Importance\nExpansion is critically important because it indicates smart money footprints, meaning institutional traders have entered the market at this point. The start of expansion provides the entry zone for traders. Entry zones found near the start of expansion can take the form of: Bullish or Bearish Order Blocks, Liquidity Voids or Price Imbalance zones, and Supply/Demand Zones. The expansion creates imbalance in price (one-sided movement) which will later need to be corrected through retracement.\n\n#### Trading Application\nTraders should always look for entry zones near the start of expansion. The starting zone of expansion provides the entry zone. When a consolidation phase is identified, traders should anticipate that expansion will follow and prepare to identify the entry zone at the origin of the expansion move. The entry zone is where smart money initiated the aggressive price move, and trading from this zone aligns the retail trader with institutional order flow. The liquidity grab or manipulation that occurs before expansion serves as a confirmation signal.",

    "retracement": {
      "llm_summary": "### Retracement\n\n#### Definition\nRetracement is a pullback within the price range that mostly occurs after expansion. It is also known as correction. The term correction refers to the market correcting itself by balancing imbalanced price. Retracement is the mechanism by which the market fills price imbalance zones and liquidity voids that were created during the expansion phase.\n\n#### Identification\nRetracement is identified as a price movement that goes against the direction of the prior expansion. After an expansion move upward, retracement appears as a downward pullback. On a chart, it can be seen as price returning to an area where one-sided movement previously occurred (the imbalance zone). The retracement area often overlaps with the price imbalance or liquidity void zones from the prior expansion. A Fair Value Gap (FVG) is noted as a refined form of liquidity void, relevant to identifying retracement targets.\n\n#### Importance\nRetracement corrects the market by balancing the imbalance price created during expansion. Where price only moves in one direction (creating imbalance), retracement fills that void. This is critical because price imbalance means price only moved one way, and the market naturally seeks to revisit and fill these zones. Retracement fills: Price Imbalance / Liquidity Voids and Fair Value Gaps (FVG), which are a refined form of liquidity void.\n\n#### Trading Application\nAfter identifying an expansion phase, traders should anticipate retracement as the next likely state. The retracement zone is where price returns to fill the imbalance created during expansion. Understanding retracement helps traders avoid entering at the end of an expansion move and instead wait for the pullback to find better entry points. After retracement completes its purpose of filling the void, the market typically expands again, creating a new trading opportunity.",

    "reversal": {
      "llm_summary": "### Reversal\n\n#### Definition\nReversal is a sign of Change of Character (CHoCH). It occurs when the direction of a price trend has changed, from going up to going down, or vice versa. A reversal marks the transition point where the prevailing trend ends and a new trend in the opposite direction begins. This concept connects directly to the Sweep Base CHoCH model covered in prior lectures on structure mapping.\n\n#### Identification\nReversal is identified on a chart by observing a trend change. In a bullish-to-bearish reversal, price was making higher highs and higher lows, then after the reversal point, begins making lower highs and lower lows. The key visual characteristic is the sweeping of a large liquidity pool followed by aggressive movement in the opposite direction. The reversal point itself is the specific price level where the direction change occurs. On the real market chart example shown, price was bullish, swept a large liquidity pool at the highs, and then transitioned to the bearish side.\n\n#### Importance\nReversal gives an advance warning to trend traders who follow the trend to design their buy and sell models. It signals that the current trend is ending and a new one is forming. Critically, reversal mostly happens when the market grabs a large liquidity pool. This connects to the Sweep Base CHoCH model from structure mapping. Understanding reversal is essential for avoiding being caught on the wrong side of a trend change and for identifying the beginning of new trending opportunities.\n\n#### Trading Application\nTraders should watch for liquidity pool sweeps as precursors to reversals. When a large liquidity pool is grabbed and price shows Change of Character, this signals a reversal. After a reversal occurs, the cycle returns to consolidation or retracement, providing the framework for anticipating the next phase. Trend traders must be aware of reversal signals to protect existing positions and identify new directional opportunities in the reversed trend.",

    "price cycle interchangeability rules": {
      "llm_summary": "### Price Cycle Interchangeability Rules\n\n#### Definition\nThe price cycle interchangeability rules define the allowed and prohibited transitions between the four elements of the price delivery cycle. While the four states (Consolidation, Expansion, Retracement, Reversal) are interchangeable, they follow specific rules about which state can follow which. Price cannot bypass the cycle; the elements are not directly interlinked in arbitrary ways. Each state transition must follow the natural process of the cycle.\n\n#### Allowed Transitions\nThe following transitions are permitted within the price cycle:\n- **Consolidation** can lead to: Expansion or Reversal\n- **Expansion** can lead to: Retracement or Consolidation\n- **Retracement** can lead to: Expansion or Reversal\n- **Reversal** can lead to: Consolidation or Retracement\n\n#### Prohibited Transitions\nThe following transitions cannot occur (price cannot bypass these rules):\n- **After Expansion, Reversal cannot occur directly** - Market cannot go to reversal zone directly after expansion; it must pass through retracement or consolidation first.\n- **After Consolidation, Retracement cannot occur** - Market cannot go to retracement after consolidation.\n- **After Retracement, Consolidation cannot occur directly** - Market cannot directly go to consolidation after retracement.\n\n#### Trading Application\nThese rules provide a structured framework for anticipating the next market state. When a trader identifies the current phase, they can narrow down the possible next states to only two options, significantly improving trade anticipation. For example, if the market is in expansion, the trader knows only retracement or consolidation can follow, never a direct reversal. This eliminates incorrect market expectations and helps traders position themselves for the most probable next move. Some abnormalities may be seen, but the cycle should be the primary framework for anticipation.",

    "liquidity in price cycle": {
      "llm_summary": "### Liquidity in Price Cycle\n\n#### Definition\nLiquidity in the context of the price delivery cycle refers to the pool of pending orders that accumulate around key price levels, particularly at the boundaries of consolidation ranges. This liquidity is the fuel that enables market movement. Consolidation creates liquidity, and smart money uses this liquidity to initiate expansion moves. The concept of liquidity connects consolidation to expansion through the mechanism of manipulation or liquidity grabs.\n\n#### Identification\nLiquidity accumulates at the highs and lows of a consolidation range where breakout traders place their pending orders. What retail traders label as resistance (upper range boundary) and support (lower range boundary) are actually liquidity zones from the ICT perspective. On charts, the liquidity grab appears as a brief price spike beyond the consolidation range boundary before the true expansion occurs. This is labeled as manipulation by smart money. In schematic diagrams, it is shown as price sweeping below support or above resistance before reversing into the expansion direction.\n\n#### Role in the Cycle\nLiquidity serves multiple roles throughout the price delivery cycle:\n1. **In Consolidation**: Breakout traders set orders on both sides of the range, building liquidity pools. Higher order count equals higher liquidity.\n2. **In Manipulation/Expansion Transition**: Smart money grabs the large liquidity pool on one side of the range before expanding in the opposite direction. This liquidity grab funds the expansion move.\n3. **In Reversal**: Reversals mostly happen when the market grabs a large liquidity pool, typically at significant swing highs or lows.\n\n#### Trading Application\nTraders should recognize that consolidation zones are liquidity-building zones, not trading zones. The larger the consolidation (more orders/liquidity), the bigger the expected expansion move. Always watch for the manipulation/liquidity grab that precedes expansion as a confirmation signal. At reversal points, the sweeping of a large liquidity pool triggers the CHoCH. Understanding liquidity flow through the cycle helps traders avoid being the liquidity (retail stop hunts) and instead trade alongside smart money after the grab occurs.",
