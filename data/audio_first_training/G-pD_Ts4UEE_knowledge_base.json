      "llm_summary": "**MARKET STRUCTURE**:\n\n1. **Definition**: Market structure refers to the overall framework and dynamics of a market, including the relationships between different market participants, the types of transactions, and the overall market volume and liquidity.\n\n2. **Identification**: To spot market structure on a chart, look for key visual characteristics such as:\n   - The distribution of market participants (e.g., the number of buyers and sellers).\n   - The types of transactions (e.g., buy, sell, and trade).\n   - The overall market volume and liquidity (e.g., the number of transactions and the size of the trades).\n   - The price levels and price movements (e.g., high, low, and close prices).\n   - The time frame and the time of day (e.g., daily, weekly, and hourly data).\n   - The presence of specific market patterns (e.g., trend, consolidation, and reversal).\n\n3. **Trading Application**: ICT recommends trading market structure patterns by focusing on key price levels and identifying the direction of price movement. For example, a bullish candlestick pattern indicates a strong upward trend, while a bearish candlestick pattern indicates a strong downward trend. Traders should also pay attention to the overall market volume and liquidity, as these factors can influence the direction of price movements.\n\n4. **Key Price Levels**: Key price levels in market structure charts include:\n   - High price\n   - Low price\n   - Close price\n   - Open price\n   - High price\n   - Low price\n   - Close price\n   - High price\n   - Low price\n   - Close price\n\n**Summary**:\nMarket structure is a fundamental aspect of trading, providing insights into the overall dynamics and relationships within a market. Traders should focus on identifying key visual characteristics such as distribution of market participants, types of transactions, overall market volume and liquidity, and specific market patterns. By understanding market structure, traders can make informed decisions and potentially capitalize on opportunities in the market.",

When an order is placed at a specific price level, the order book will show the number of shares available for sale or purchase at that price level.

This can occur after an expansion phase, where the price line is not perfectly aligned with the trend.\n\n#### Identification\nImbalance can be identified by observing specific chart patterns and price levels. Key visual characteristics include:\n1. **Order Block**:\n   - Highlighted areas on a chart where the order block is present, indicating critical price levels or zones where traders are likely to enter or exit the trade.\n\n#### Trading Application\nICT recommends trading this pattern by focusing on specific entry zones, such as retracement areas, which occur after an expansion phase. These entry zones are crucial for identifying potential retracement opportunities, which can fill the price imbalance and liquidity voids.\n\n#### Key Price Levels\nKey price levels important for trading IMBALANCE include:\n1. **Retracement**:\n   - A common pattern where the price line retraces after an expansion phase, indicating potential retracement opportunities.\n\n#### Conclusion\nImbalance is a critical concept in trading, representing a price imbalance where the price action does not align with the expected direction. By identifying specific chart patterns and price levels, traders can effectively trade this pattern, focusing on retracement areas to fill the price imbalance and liquidity voids.",
