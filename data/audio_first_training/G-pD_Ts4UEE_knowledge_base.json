Every market cycle follows this pattern. Understanding which phase market is in allows traders to align with Smart Money activity and avoid trading against institutional positioning. Each phase has distinct characteristics, trading opportunities, and risks.",

Market consolidates in a range, creating sideways movement. Retail sees 'boring' market with no clear direction. Smart Money uses this ranging phase to accumulate positions without moving price significantly. Low volume, tight ranges, and lack of retail participation characterize accumulation.
