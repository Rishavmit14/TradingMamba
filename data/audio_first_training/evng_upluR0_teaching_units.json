Second one is major inducement level which is created by deeper pullback. Let's understand these points with simple schematic diagrams. In this diagram, if you notice that this first one is deeper pullback as compared to others. So, we will mark this level as major inducement level. These two are short pullbacks as compared to this one. So we will mark them as minor inducements levels. Here is another diagram. There are multiple inducement levels in this swing.
