Fake CHoCH occurs when market breaks a swing point that LOOKS like valid structure but fails validation rules - resulting in retail traders entering reversal trades that get stopped out while price continues in the original trend direction. Understanding fake vs valid CHoCH is critical to avoid being trapped. The video teaches 4 specific rules to distinguish fake from valid CHoCH.",
