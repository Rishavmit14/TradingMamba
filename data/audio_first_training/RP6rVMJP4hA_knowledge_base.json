      "llm_summary": "## Definition\nThe Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) is ICT's signature entry technique that combines Fibonacci retracement levels with specific time windows to identify high-probability trade entries. The OTE zone is defined as the area between the 62% and 79% Fibonacci retracement levels of a price swing.\n\n## Rules\n1. **Time Window Requirement**: OTE entries should occur within the 8:30 AM to 11:00 AM New York time window for maximum probability\n2. **Retracement Zone**: Enter trades when price retraces into the 62%-79% Fibonacci zone (the OTE sweet spot)\n3. **Minimum Entry**: The 62% retracement level represents the minimum acceptable entry point\n4. **Stop Loss Placement**: Place stops 10 pips below the swing low for long trades (or above swing high for shorts)\n5. **Standard Deviation Targets**: Use 1, 1.5, and 2 standard deviations of the OTE range as profit targets\n\n## Identification\n- Identify a clear swing high and swing low\n- Apply Fibonacci retracement from low to high (for longs) or high to low (for shorts)\n- Wait for price to retrace into the 62%-79% zone during the New York session time window\n- Look for price to show rejection at these levels (wicks, reversal candles)\n- In this video example: Entry at 0.6619 on AUD/USD with 4-pip drawdown and 10-pip stop, targeting 39 pips at 2 standard deviations",

      "llm_summary": "## Definition\nFibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool that uses horizontal lines to indicate areas of support or resistance at the key Fibonacci levels before the price continues in the original direction. In ICT methodology, the focus is specifically on the 62%, 70.5%, and 79% levels which form the Optimal Trade Entry zone.\n\n## Rules\n1. **Drawing the Fib**: Always draw from the origin of the move (swing low for bullish, swing high for bearish)\n2. **Key Levels**: Focus on 0.5 (50%), 0.618 (62%), 0.705 (70.5%), and 0.79 (79%) levels\n3. **OTE Zone**: The 62%-79% zone is the premium retracement area where smart money accumulates\n4. **Confluence**: Combine Fibonacci levels with order blocks and time for highest probability setups\n5. **Extension Levels**: Use -1, -1.5, and -2 (standard deviations) as profit targets beyond the swing\n\n## Identification\n- Identify a completed swing (high to low or low to high)\n- Apply the Fibonacci tool from origin to terminus of the swing\n- The retracement zone between 62% and 79% is the optimal entry area\n- In this video: The chart shows Fibonacci levels at 0.62, 0.705, and 0.79 with specific price levels marked (0.6619 entry point)",

This creates a visible target that attracts retail traders to place sell stops above, while also serving as buy-side liquidity that smart money will seek to capture.\n\n## Rules\n1. **Liquidity Pool**: Equal highs represent resting buy stops above the market\n2. **Target for Price**: Smart money algorithms will often drive price to sweep equal highs before reversing\n3. **Do Not Fade Directly**: Avoid selling at equal highs; instead, wait for the sweep and reaction\n4. **Confirmation Required**: After equal highs are swept, look for displacement and market structure shift before entering\n5. **Time Context**: Equal highs formed during consolidation are more significant than those during trends\n\n## Identification\n- Look for two or more swing highs at nearly identical price levels\n- These often appear as a flat ceiling or resistance level on the chart\n- Price will gravitate toward these levels to collect liquidity\n- In the video: Equal highs are shown as a target level that price returns to, offering potential profit targets",

It represents the footprint of institutional order flow - where smart money placed their orders before driving price in their intended direction. For bullish moves, it's the last bearish candle before the rally; for bearish moves, it's the last bullish candle before the decline.\n\n## Rules\n1. **Bullish Order Block**: The last down-close candle before a significant up move (look for longs)\n2. **Bearish Order Block**: The last up-close candle before a significant down move (look for shorts)\n3. **Entry**: Enter when price returns to the order block body (between open and close of the candle)\n4. **Stop Placement**: Place stops beyond the order block's wick/extreme\n5. **Validation**: Order blocks are most valid when followed by displacement (impulsive move away)\n\n## Identification\n- Find a significant price move (break of structure or displacement)\n- Identify the last opposite-color candle before that move\n- The body of that candle is the order block zone\n- Price returning to this zone offers a high-probability entry\n- In this video: Order blocks are referenced as key areas where price shows significant reactions",

The primary New York session time window is 8:30 AM to 11:00 AM New York time, which coincides with the equity market open and major economic releases.\n\n## Rules\n1. **Primary Window**: 8:30 AM - 11:00 AM New York time is the optimal trading window\n2. **Kill Zone Overlap**: This window overlaps with the New York Kill Zone for highest probability\n3. **News Events**: Major economic releases at 8:30 AM often trigger the moves ICT anticipates\n4. **Avoid Lunch**: 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM typically shows reduced volatility and choppy action\n5. **Session Context**: Understand the Asian and London sessions leading into New York for bias\n\n## Identification\n- Mark the 8:30 AM candle on your chart as the session reference point\n- Look for OTE setups that form specifically within this time window\n- The video shows the chart with time markers indicating the New York session\n- Price action at exactly 8:30 AM is highlighted as the key entry moment\n- In this example: Entry occurred 'dead on' at 8:30 AM demonstrating time precision",

Rather than arbitrary pip targets, these are mathematically derived from the OTE entry range and projected beyond the swing high/low to identify where price is likely to reach.\n\n## Rules\n1. **One Standard Deviation (-1)**: First profit target, typically reached quickly after entry\n2. **One and Half Standard Deviation (-1.5)**: Secondary target for scaling out positions\n3. **Two Standard Deviations (-2)**: Full target representing the complete OTE range projection\n4. **Partial Profits**: Scale out of positions at each level (e.g., 1/3 at each target)\n5. **Breakeven Stop**: Move stop to breakeven after first target is reached\n\n## Identification\n- After identifying the OTE entry, project Fibonacci extensions beyond the swing\n- The -1, -1.5, and -2 levels serve as profit targets\n- In this video: The chart shows targets at -1 (10 pips), -1.5 (20 pips), and -2 (39 pips)\n- The example demonstrates 'offering 39 pips just in this short little run' at 2 standard deviations",
