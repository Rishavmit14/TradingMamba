      "llm_summary": "**LIQUIDITY** is a trading strategy that involves identifying and trading in price movements that are not necessarily continuous but have a pattern of high and low prices. The key visual characteristics of liquidity sweep are:\n1. **Inducement**: Inducement is not required to mark liquidity sweep. This is independent from inducement.\n2. **Candle Closing Below Inducement**: Candle closing below inducement will invalidate the liquidity sweep. To understand the concept of liquidity sweep, you can click on I button on right corner for its complete understanding.\n\n**Trading Application**:\n- **Identification**: ICT recommends trading liquidity sweep by identifying price movements that are not necessarily continuous but have a pattern of high and low prices.\n- **Trading Strategy**: Once identified, traders should focus on trading in these price movements, as they are not necessarily continuous but have a pattern of high and low prices.\n\n**Key Price Levels**:\n- **Swing High**: Swing high is a high price that is not necessarily followed by a high price, indicating a period of price stability or consolidation.\n- **Swing Low**: Swing low is a low price that is not necessarily followed by a low price, indicating a period of price stability or consolidation.\n\n**Summary**:\nLIQUIDITY is a trading strategy that involves identifying and trading in price movements that are not necessarily continuous but have a pattern of high and low prices. The key visual characteristics of liquidity sweep are inducement, candle closing below inducement, and swing highs and lows.

This can be done by examining the price levels, the types of transactions, and the overall organization of the market.\n\n4. **Key Price Levels**: Key price levels in market structure include swing highs and lows, which are price movements that are not necessarily continuous but have a pattern of high and low prices. Swing highs and lows are important in identifying market structure.\n\n5. **Key Visual Characteristics**: Key visual characteristics in market structure include break of structure, which is a significant change in the price action, and swing highs and lows, which are price movements that are not necessarily continuous but have a pattern of high and low prices.

The key price levels to monitor are swing highs, and the chart patterns to look for include a break of structure, which indicates a significant change in the price action.
