      "llm_summary": "**DEFINITION:** The Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) is the premium retracement zone between the 62% and 79% Fibonacci levels where institutional traders seek entries. In this episode, ICT demonstrates OTE on GBP/USD (Cable) during the New York session, showing how price retraces into this zone before continuing the primary trend direction.\n\n**RULES:**\n1. Draw Fibonacci from the swing low to swing high (for longs) or swing high to swing low (for shorts)\n2. The OTE zone spans from 0.62 (62%) to 0.79 (79%) retracement levels\n3. The 0.705 level (70.5%) is the 'sweet spot' within the OTE zone\n4. Wait for price to trade into the OTE zone during a kill zone time window\n5. Look for confluence with other concepts (order blocks, liquidity sweeps) within the OTE zone\n\n**IDENTIFICATION:**\n- Apply Fibonacci retracement tool from swing point #1 (1.21554) to swing point #2 (1.22090)\n- OTE zone visible between 0.62 (1.21758) and 0.79 levels on the chart\n- The 0.5 level (1.21822) marks the equilibrium/midpoint\n- Price reaching the OTE zone during New York session provides optimal entry conditions\n- Look for the setup during the 8:30 AM to 11:00 AM New York time window",

      "llm_summary": "**DEFINITION:** Friday's High and Low are key reference levels used when trading on Monday. ICT teaches that when analyzing charts on Monday, traders should disregard Sunday's price action and instead use Friday's high and low as the relevant previous day levels for establishing bias and identifying liquidity pools.\n\n**RULES:**\n1. When trading on Monday, treat Friday as the 'previous day' - ignore Sunday completely\n2. Friday's high represents buy-side liquidity (buy stops resting above)\n3. Friday's low represents sell-side liquidity (sell stops resting below)\n4. Use Friday's range to determine Monday's directional bias\n5. The midpoint of Friday's range can serve as an equilibrium reference\n\n**IDENTIFICATION:**\n- On Monday's chart, mark Friday's high and Friday's low with horizontal lines\n- Do NOT use Sunday's high/low as reference points\n- Look for price to sweep Friday's high or low to capture liquidity\n- Combine with New York session timing for high-probability setups\n- Friday's range provides context for potential Monday targets",

    "new york session": {
      "llm_summary": "**DEFINITION:** The New York Session, specifically the 'Kill Zone' from 8:30 AM to 11:00 AM New York time, is ICT's preferred trading window. This period offers the highest probability setups due to increased institutional participation, news releases, and liquidity. The session box visible on charts helps traders identify this critical time window.\n\n**RULES:**\n1. The New York Kill Zone runs from 8:30 AM to 11:00 AM Eastern Time\n2. This is when major economic news releases occur (especially at 8:30 AM)\n3. Look for OTE setups that form during this time window\n4. The Kill Zone often produces the day's high or low\n5. Avoid trading outside the Kill Zone unless you have strong confluence\n\n**IDENTIFICATION:**\n- Mark the New York Session box on your chart (8:30 AM - 11:00 AM ET)\n- The session box appears in the chart frames showing GBP/USD price action\n- Price levels during this video: 1.21330 to 1.22254 range\n- Look for OTE retracements that complete within this time window\n- Institutional activity is highest during this period",

    "fibonacci retracement": {
      "llm_summary": "**DEFINITION:** Fibonacci Retracement is a technical tool used to identify potential support and resistance levels based on the Fibonacci sequence ratios. ICT uses specific Fibonacci levels (0.5, 0.62, 0.705, 0.79, 1.0) to frame the OTE zone and provide visual reference points for trade entries.\n\n**RULES:**\n1. Anchor point #1 goes on the swing low (for bullish setups) or swing high (for bearish setups)\n2. Anchor point #2 goes on the opposing swing point\n3. Key levels to monitor: 0.5 (equilibrium), 0.62, 0.705 (sweet spot), 0.79\n4. The zone between 0.62 and 0.79 is the OTE - optimal for entries\n5. Price often respects these levels, especially during Kill Zone times\n\n**IDENTIFICATION:**\n- In the video, Fib drawn from #1 (1.21554) to #2 (1.22090)\n- 0.5 level = 1.21822 (equilibrium/midpoint)\n- 0.62 level = 1.21758 (start of OTE zone)\n- 0.705 level = sweet spot within OTE\n- 0.79 level = deep OTE boundary\n- 1.0 level = 1.21554 (full retracement to swing origin)\n- Use these levels to plan entry, stop loss, and take profit",

    "equal highs": {
      "llm_summary": "**DEFINITION:** Equal Highs are price levels where the market has formed two or more highs at approximately the same price, creating a visible horizontal resistance level. These levels represent buy-side liquidity pools where retail traders place buy stops and breakout orders, making them targets for smart money to hunt.\n\n**RULES:**\n1. Equal highs form when price touches the same high level multiple times\n2. These levels attract retail buy stops (liquidity)\n3. Smart money often drives price above equal highs to trigger stops before reversing\n4. After liquidity is swept, look for reversal entries\n5. Equal highs become more significant with more touches\n\n**IDENTIFICATION:**\n- Look for two or more highs at nearly identical price levels\n- The chart shows instances around 1.22045 to 1.22100 area\n- Draw a horizontal line connecting the equal highs\n- Monitor for price to sweep above these highs (liquidity grab)\n- After the sweep, look for bearish order flow for short entries",

      "llm_summary": "**DEFINITION:** Liquidity refers to the clusters of stop-loss orders and pending orders resting at key price levels. ICT teaches that institutional traders (smart money) target these liquidity pools to fill their large orders. Understanding where liquidity rests allows traders to anticipate price movements and avoid being the liquidity that gets hunted.\n\n**RULES:**\n1. Buy-side liquidity rests above swing highs, equal highs, and previous day highs\n2. Sell-side liquidity rests below swing lows, equal lows, and previous day lows\n3. Smart money drives price toward liquidity pools to fill institutional orders\n4. After liquidity is taken, expect potential reversals\n5. Friday's high/low levels represent significant liquidity pools for Monday trading\n\n**IDENTIFICATION:**\n- Mark equal highs and equal lows on your chart\n- Friday's high = buy-side liquidity target\n- Friday's low = sell-side liquidity target\n- Previous session highs/lows contain resting orders\n- Watch for 'liquidity sweeps' - quick moves above/below key levels followed by reversals",

These candles represent areas where institutional orders were placed, and price often returns to these zones before continuing in the direction of the initial move.\n\n**RULES:**\n1. Bullish Order Block = last bearish candle before price moves up significantly\n2. Bearish Order Block = last bullish candle before price moves down significantly\n3. Look for price to return to the order block zone for entry\n4. Order blocks within the OTE zone provide high-probability entry points\n5. The body of the order block candle is more significant than the wicks\n\n**IDENTIFICATION:**\n- Identify the last opposing candle before a strong directional move\n- Mark the high and low of that candle as your order block zone\n- Wait for price to retrace back into this zone\n- Combine with OTE levels for confluence (OB within 62-79% zone)\n- The order block provides the specific entry point within the broader OTE zone",
