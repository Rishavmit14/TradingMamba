## PULLBACK

*Teaching time: 1.0 min | Words: 180 | Frames: 6*

### Pullback — Foundation for Valid Inducement

A pullback occurs when price pauses and corrects itself or goes against the trend. It is a temporary dip in a trending market. NOT every pullback is valid — validity must be confirmed by a liquidity sweep.

## VALID PULLBACK

*Teaching time: 5.0 min | Words: 600 | Frames: 20*

### Valid Pullback — The Liquidity Sweep Confirmation

The ONLY confirmation factor for a valid pullback is a liquidity sweep.

**Bullish Market**: Find the HIGHEST candle, the LOW must be broken by next candle(s).
**Bearish Market**: Find the LOWEST candle, the HIGH must be broken by next candle(s).

Both wick-based and body-based sweeps are valid. Teacher provides 8 worked examples with numbered/lettered candles showing valid/invalid cases. Common retail mistake: picking the wrong candle as highest/lowest.

## LIQUIDITY SWEEP

*Teaching time: 3.0 min | Words: 300 | Frames: 12*

### Liquidity Sweep — Institutional Execution Footprint

Expanded from Video 2: sweeps are used by institutions to execute large orders. Smart money targets the LARGER liquidity pool side first. Demonstrated with buy stops (n=100) vs sell stops (n=10,000) example. Mapped from schematic to candlestick form with X cross notation.

## VALID INDUCEMENT

*Teaching time: 2.3 min | Words: 350 | Frames: 8*

### Valid Inducement — First Valid Pullback on Left Side

Inducement is the FIRST VALID PULLBACK on the left side of recent high/low. Systematic identification: find swing point → look left → find first pullback → validate with pullback rules → if valid, mark as IDM. Pullbacks without liquidity sweep are FAKE inducement.

### Candlestick Analysis — Reading Sweep Patterns

Open to Close = body, High/Low beyond body = wicks (sweep zones). Both wick-based and body-based sweeps are valid for pullback confirmation.
