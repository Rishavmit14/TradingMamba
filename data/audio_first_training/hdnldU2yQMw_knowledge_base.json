      "llm_summary": "Million Dollar Setup is the combination of ALL major SMC concepts into one high-probability trade setup. It integrates: 1) Trend identification (structure mapping), 2) CHoCH confirmation, 3) Order Block identification, 4) Fair Value Gap, 5) Premium/Discount zones, 6) Inducement taken, 7) Optimal entry timing. When all these elements align, it creates the highest probability setup in SMC trading - hence the name 'Million Dollar Setup'. This is not a single pattern but a confluence of multiple validated concepts.",

Many traders fail because they trade impatiently with only 1-2 confluences instead of waiting for full alignment. Quality over quantity is the mantra.",
