The main focus is on the \"order block\" or \"supply zone\" identified by ICT.\n   - The chart indicates a swing-based trading model (CHoCH) with several consolidation periods (HL) and higher time frames (HH).\n\n2. **Annotations and Markings**:\n   - The chart includes annotations and markings such as \"HH\" (higher high), \"IDM\" (lower high), and \"HL\" (higher low).\n   - The \"CHoCH\" indication is marked with a pink arrow.\n   - The \"CHoCH\" consolidation periods are marked with green circles.\n\n3. **Timeframe and Trading Pair**:\n   - The chart is in a higher time frame (HTF) and lower time frame (IDM).\n   - The trading pair is not explicitly mentioned, but the swing-based model suggests it could be a currency pair or a stock index.\n\n4. **Teaching Context**:\n   - The teaching context is focused on explaining the \"order block\" or \"supply zone\" in a swing-based trading model.\n   - ICT is pointing to specific areas on the chart, such as the \"order block\" or \"supply zone\" identified by the \"CHoCH\" consolidation periods.\n   - The audio teaching emphasizes the importance of waiting for another lower time frame trend reversal indication or chalk level to confirm the cell model.\n\n5. **Detailed Description**:\n   - The chart visually supports the teaching by showing the \"order block\" or \"supply zone\" identified by the \"CHoCH\" consolidation periods.\n   - The \"CHoCH\" consolidation periods are marked with green circles, indicating periods of consolidation.\n   - The \"CHoCH\" consolidation periods are marked with \"HL\" (higher low) and \"IDM\" (lower high).\n   -

It is the lower boundary of the candle, which is a price range where the price is expected to move. The candle body is a critical point for identifying potential entry points in trading.\n\n2. **Valid Pullback**: The pullback is a price movement below the candle body, which is a significant price level. It is a critical point for identifying potential entry points in trading.\n\n3. **Valid High**: The valid high is a price level where the price is expected to move higher. It is a critical point for identifying potential entry points in trading.\n\n4. **Valid Low**: The valid low is a price level where the price is expected to move lower. It is a critical point for identifying potential entry points in trading.\n\n5. **Candle Pattern**: The candle pattern is a specific type of price chart used in trading. It consists of a body, a lower shadow, and a upper shadow. The body represents the price range where the price is expected to move, and the lower and upper shadows represent the price range where the price is expected to move higher and lower, respectively.\n\n6. **Swing Based Model (CHoCH)**: The swing based model (CHoCH) is a specific trading strategy used in trading. It involves identifying and entering trades based on the price movements in a specific timeframe. The CHoCH model involves identifying a specific price level, which is a critical point for identifying potential entry points, and then following the price movements in a specific timeframe to identify potential exit points.\n\nThe visual supports the audio teaching by providing a clear and structured representation of the trading concepts being discussed. The chart patterns and annotations highlight the specific price levels and trading strategies being explained, making the information easily understandable.",
