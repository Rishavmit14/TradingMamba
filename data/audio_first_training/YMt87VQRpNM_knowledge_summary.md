## EQUAL LOWS

*Teaching time: 0.2 min | Words: 32 | Frames: 2 | Generation time: 29.2s*

The "Equal Low" concept, as taught by ICT, involves identifying instances where the closing price bars on a chart are aligned at the same price level. These instances are highlighted in green and black bars, respectively, and are observed on the chart. The key visual characteristics to spot an equal low are the aligned price bars, which indicate a potential target for trading. ICT recommends trading this pattern by entering the trade at specific areas on the chart where the price bars are aligned at the same price level. The important price levels to consider are those where the price bars are aligned, as these could represent potential entry points for a trade. The Equal Low concept is a useful tool for identifying potential trading opportunities in the forex market.

## OPTIMAL TRADE ENTRY

*Teaching time: 1.0 min | Words: 153 | Frames: 7 | Generation time: 30.8s*

The "Optimal Trade Entry" concept, as taught by the International Traders, involves identifying and entering the market at a higher price level. This is achieved by identifying a 62% retracement level entry at 1.77, which is 20-30 seconds away from the current price. The chart analysis shows specific price levels, such as the open interest at 17,724, which is the highest in the September contract. The chart also includes annotations, markings, or highlighted areas, such as the black and green bars, which represent different price levels and trading volumes. The optimal trade entry is recommended for traders who are willing to take on higher risk, as it involves off-exchange foreign currency trading on margin. The risk associated with this pattern is high, as it involves off-exchange foreign currency trading, which carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors.
