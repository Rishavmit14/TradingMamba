This is common in real market conditions where price makes several retracements before the final impulse move. Every valid pullback can technically act as an inducement. The critical question becomes: which inducement should be used for high probability setups? Understanding how to identify the HIGHEST PROBABILITY inducement among multiple candidates is essential for accurate structure mapping and entry planning.",
