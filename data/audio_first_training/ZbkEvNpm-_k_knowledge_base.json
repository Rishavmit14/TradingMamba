      "llm_summary": "**DEFINITION:**\nOptimal Trade Entry (OTE) is ICT's signature entry technique based on Fibonacci retracement levels applied to price swings. It identifies high-probability entry zones during price retracements within a trending move. The OTE zone specifically targets the 62% to 79% retracement area (between the -0.5 and -1 Fibonacci levels) where institutional orders are likely to be positioned.\n\n**RULES:**\n1. Only take OTE entries in the direction of the higher timeframe bias\n2. The OTE zone lies between the 62% (-0.5 Fib) and 79% (-1 Fib) retracement levels\n3. Wait for price to trade into the OTE zone during the New York session (8:30-11:00 AM EST)\n4. Combine with a bearish or bullish order block within the OTE zone for confluence\n5. Stop loss goes beyond the swing high/low that created the retracement\n6. Take profits at logical levels: Previous Day High/Low, Fair Value Gaps, or swing projections\n\n**IDENTIFICATION:**\n1. Establish higher timeframe directional bias using daily chart analysis\n2. Identify a clear swing high and swing low on the lower timeframe\n3. Apply Fibonacci retracement from swing low to swing high (for longs) or swing high to swing low (for shorts)\n4. Mark the OTE zone between -0.5 (62%) and -1 (79%) levels\n5. Look for price to retrace into this zone during the kill zone timing\n6. Enter at the OTE zone with a stop beyond the swing point and target the opposite liquidity pool",

    "fair value gap": {
      "llm_summary": "**DEFINITION:**\nA Fair Value Gap (FVG) is an imbalance in price created when there is a gap between the wicks of non-adjacent candles. It represents an area where price moved so quickly that no trading occurred, creating an inefficiency that the market typically seeks to fill. ICT teaches that gaps act as magnets or 'draws on liquidity' that price will gravitate toward.\n\n**RULES:**\n1. A bullish FVG forms when a candle's low is higher than the high of the candle two bars prior (gap up)\n2. A bearish FVG forms when a candle's high is lower than the low of the candle two bars prior (gap down)\n3. Price has a natural tendency to return and fill these gaps (trade through them)\n4. FVGs on higher timeframes are more significant and act as stronger draws on liquidity\n5. Use FVGs as both entry zones and profit targets\n6. The gap is measured from the low of the prior candle to the high of the subsequent candle (for bullish) or vice versa\n\n**IDENTIFICATION:**\n1. Look for three consecutive candles where the middle candle has separated the wicks of the outer candles\n2. On the daily chart, gaps are visible where price jumped between sessions\n3. Mark the high and low of the gap zone\n4. The market will likely trade back into this area to 'fill the gap'\n5. In this video, the gap from the March crash created a draw on liquidity that crude oil was gravitating toward",

    "liquidity": {
      "llm_summary": "**DEFINITION:**\nLiquidity refers to resting orders in the market - specifically stop losses and pending orders clustered at obvious price levels. ICT teaches that smart money seeks liquidity to fill their large positions. Areas of liquidity include: previous swing highs/lows, equal highs/lows, fair value gaps, and obvious support/resistance levels where retail traders place their stops.\n\n**RULES:**\n1. Liquidity pools form above swing highs (buy stops from shorts) and below swing lows (sell stops from longs)\n2. Smart money needs liquidity to enter and exit large positions without excessive slippage\n3. Price is drawn to liquidity pools like a magnet - the market seeks to 'raid' these areas\n4. Fair Value Gaps represent areas of poor liquidity that price seeks to fill\n5. Understanding where liquidity rests helps predict where price will go next\n6. Never place stops at obvious levels - they will be hunted\n\n**IDENTIFICATION:**\n1. Mark previous swing highs and lows - these have stop losses above/below them\n2. Identify equal highs/lows - doubled liquidity at these levels\n3. Note obvious support/resistance levels - retail traders place stops just beyond these\n4. Fair value gaps represent 'draws on liquidity' where price wants to trade\n5. In this video, ICT shows how the old high at $35.18 had sell stops resting above it from retail shorts, and the gap acted as a liquidity draw pulling price higher",

    "retail trader resistance": {
      "llm_summary": "**DEFINITION:**\nRetail Trader's Resistance refers to price levels that retail traders perceive as resistance based on traditional technical analysis concepts (double tops, previous highs, etc.). ICT teaches that these levels are actually liquidity pools that smart money will target. What retail sees as resistance, smart money sees as a target to raid for liquidity.\n\n**RULES:**\n1. When retail traders see a previous high as resistance, they place sell stops above it\n2. Smart money knows where retail places stops and will engineer price to raid these levels\n3. The more obvious a resistance level, the more liquidity exists above it\n4. Retail expects price to reject at resistance - smart money expects a liquidity raid\n5. Use retail logic in reverse: what they see as resistance, you see as a target\n6. Once stops are raided above 'resistance', price often reverses quickly\n\n**IDENTIFICATION:**\n1. Find levels where price previously rejected (creating obvious highs or double tops)\n2. These are where retail traders will short and place stops above\n3. In this video, the $35.18 level was 'Retail Trader's Resistance' - a previous high where retail shorts would place their stops\n4. ICT shows how to fade this bias by expecting price to raid above this level before any meaningful reversal\n5. The key is thinking opposite to the 90% of traders who lose money",

    "previous day high low": {
      "llm_summary": "**DEFINITION:**\nPrevious Day High (PDH) and Previous Day Low (PDL) are the high and low prices from the prior trading day. These levels are fundamental reference points in ICT methodology because they represent key liquidity pools. Smart money frequently targets these levels during the current trading day to accumulate or distribute positions.\n\n**RULES:**\n1. Always mark the previous day's high and low before the trading day begins\n2. PDH has buy stops above it (from traders short with stops above the high)\n3. PDL has sell stops below it (from traders long with stops below the low)\n4. Price frequently trades to PDH or PDL during the New York session\n5. Use PDH/PDL as targets for intraday trades and as potential reversal zones\n6. A trade to PDH/PDL followed by reversal often signals the true daily direction\n\n**IDENTIFICATION:**\n1. Mark the high and low of the previous day's candle on your chart\n2. These levels should be drawn and observed before the trading day\n3. In this video, ICT marks 'Previous Day High' at $34.21 as a key level to watch\n4. The expectation was for price to trade through this level to raid liquidity before continuing higher\n5. Combined with the OTE entry, PDH provided a logical take-profit target",

    "smart money concepts": {
      "llm_summary": "**DEFINITION:**\nSmart Money Concepts (SMC) is the overarching framework that explains how institutional traders (banks, hedge funds) manipulate price to accumulate and distribute positions. ICT teaches that 90% of retail traders lose because they use flawed logic taught in books. Smart money exploits this by engineering price moves to trigger retail stop losses before moving price in the intended direction.\n\n**RULES:**\n1. Think opposite to what retail technical analysis teaches\n2. What retail sees as support/resistance, smart money sees as liquidity to raid\n3. Smart money needs liquidity (retail stops) to fill their large orders\n4. Price movements are engineered - not random or based on chart patterns\n5. 90% of traders lose - align with the 10% by understanding institutional behavior\n6. Smart money accumulates during consolidation and distributes during trends\n\n**IDENTIFICATION:**\n1. When a setup looks 'too obvious' to retail, expect smart money to fade it\n2. If retail expects resistance to hold, expect a stop hunt above it first\n3. If retail expects support to hold, expect a stop hunt below it first\n4. In this video, ICT demonstrates how retail saw resistance at $35.18 while smart money saw a liquidity target\n5. The key insight: use retail logic to identify where stops are, then trade with smart money to raid those stops",

    "bias determination": {
      "llm_summary": "**DEFINITION:**\nBias determination is the process of establishing the directional lean for a trading session or period. ICT teaches using higher timeframe analysis - specifically daily and weekly charts - to determine whether to be bullish or bearish. The bias is not about predicting every move, but establishing the path of least resistance for price.\n\n**RULES:**\n1. Always determine bias BEFORE looking for trade setups\n2. Use the daily chart to establish weekly directional bias\n3. Look for draws on liquidity (gaps, untested highs/lows) to determine where price wants to go\n4. A market predisposed to go higher will seek buy-side liquidity (highs)\n5. A market predisposed to go lower will seek sell-side liquidity (lows)\n6. Only take OTE entries that align with your higher timeframe bias\n\n**IDENTIFICATION:**\n1. On the daily chart, identify where the unfilled fair value gaps are\n2. Determine which liquidity pools (highs or lows) have not been raided recently\n3. In this video, ICT shows crude oil had a gap above from the March crash that created bullish bias\n4. Despite retail seeing 'resistance', the gap created a draw on liquidity pulling price higher\n5. This gave a bullish bias for swing trading and intraday long setups",

    "new york session": {
      "llm_summary": "**DEFINITION:**\nThe New York Session (specifically 8:30 AM - 11:00 AM EST) is ICT's primary trading window for OTE setups. This period, also called the 'New York Kill Zone', is when the most significant price moves occur due to the overlap with London session close and the release of major economic data. ICT teaches that OTE entries during this window have the highest probability of success.\n\n**RULES:**\n1. The New York Kill Zone runs from 8:30 AM to 11:00 AM EST\n2. This is the optimal time window to look for OTE entries\n3. Major economic releases occur at 8:30 AM and 10:00 AM, creating volatility\n4. The session often produces the daily high or low\n5. Look for price to sweep liquidity pools and then reverse during this window\n6. Avoid trading outside the kill zones unless you have exceptional confluence\n\n**IDENTIFICATION:**\n1. Mark the 8:30 - 11:00 AM EST window on your intraday charts\n2. Wait for price to reach your OTE zone during this time\n3. In this video, ICT shows the entry at 32.75 occurred during the New York session\n4. The session box shows the 'New York Session' label marking this critical trading window\n5. The example shows a 26-point stop with targets at +35, +75, +109, and +175 points",
