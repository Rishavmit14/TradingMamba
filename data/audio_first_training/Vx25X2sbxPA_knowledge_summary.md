## ORDER BLOCK

*Teaching time: 1.3 min | Words: 240 | Frames: 8 | Generation time: 30.6s*

ORDER BLOCK is a specific trading pattern identified on a chart, characterized by a high on a candle, typically near the end of a trading session, and a near-term objective. The high on this candle is marked by a specific price level, and the trader aims to achieve this objective. ORDER BLOCK is a bread-and-butter approach to trading, focusing on identifying and trading specific candle patterns, which are then used as entry and exit points. The trader should not invest money that they cannot afford to lose, and should not sustain a loss of some or all of their initial investment. ORDER BLOCK is a risk management strategy, as it involves taking a high level of risk, which may not be suitable for all investors.
