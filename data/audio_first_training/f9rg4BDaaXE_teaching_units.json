To understand the validity of inducement, first we have to understand that what is pullback. Basically, a pullback occurs when the price takes break or pauses and correct itself or goes against trend in the market. Many of you may be called it as correction. Notice that it is a temporary dip in a generally upward trending market.",

By this concept, now you can understand that smart money, big institutions and banks want bigger liquidity pool, or you can say buyer or sellers with open interest to buy from them or to sell them. Once bank will sell you on higher price or buy from you on lower price, they will not allow you to get that better price again.
