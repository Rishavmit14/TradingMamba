    "text": "Welcome back. And welcome to Forex Minions. Today, our topic of discussion is pullbacks and valid inducement. We will learn how to identify valid inducement or fake inducement. To understand the validity of inducement, first we have to understand that what is pullback. Basically, a pullback occurs when the price takes break or pauses and correct itself or goes against trend in the market. Many of you may be called it as correction. Notice that it is a temporary dip in a generally upward trending market. Just for understand, note the schematic diagram of pullback. These are pullback in bullish market. Pullback can be very short or extended depending on market conditions. Secondly, these are pullback in bearish market. Pullbacks can be very minor or in form of deeper correction as you can see here.",

To sell such huge amount of orders, you need a huge buyer pool or interested buyers to whom you can sell your orders. By this concept, now you can understand that smart money, big institutions and banks want bigger liquidity pool, or you can say buyer or sellers with open interest to buy from them or to sell them. Once bank will sell you on higher price or buy from you on lower price, they will not allow you to get that better price again. That's why liquidity sweeping move is very quick and efficient and it reflects the footprint of smart money executions.",
