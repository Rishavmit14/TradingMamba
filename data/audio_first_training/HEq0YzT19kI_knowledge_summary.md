## FAIR VALUE GAP

*Teaching time: 0.1 min | Words: 25 | Frames: 1 | Generation time: 27.3s*

The FAIR VALUE GAP concept, as taught by the Inner Circle Trader (ICT), involves identifying a gap between the high and low prices on a chart, which ICT refers to as a "fair value gap." To spot this pattern on a chart, key visual characteristics to look for include:

1. **Visible Price Levels**: Specific price levels, such as 1784.415, 1784.415, and 1784.415, which are likely important price points for trading.
2. **Highlighted Areas**: Specific highlighted areas, such as the "Liquidity Sweep" and "Base Base Model," which ICT is referencing.
3. **Annotations, Markings, or Highlighted Areas**: Annotations indicating specific areas, such as "Liquidity Sweep" and "Base Base Model," which ICT is referencing.

The FAIR VALUE GAP pattern is recommended for trading because it indicates a potential imbalance in price action, which can be a sign of underlying market movement. ICT suggests that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds, making it a valuable trading opportunity. The fair value gap pattern can be a good indicator for identifying potential entry points and exit strategies in trading.

In the context of the Higher Highs concept, the ICT methodology suggests trading higher highs. This involves identifying higher highs on a chart and taking positions when the price breaks out of the higher high. The goal is to capitalize on the bullish momentum created by the higher highs.

#### Key Price Levels
The key price levels to consider in the Higher Highs concept are:
1. The previous high, which is the starting point for the bullish trend.
2. The higher high, which indicates the continuation of the bullish trend.
3. The candle body closing above the previous high, which confirms the higher high.

#### Risks
There are risks associated with trading higher highs, including the possibility of a reversal or a bearish trend. The trader must be aware of the potential for a reversal and adjust their strategy accordingly.

#### Conclusion
Higher highs are a key concept in the Higher Highs trading strategy, indicating a bullish trend. The candle body closing above the previous high confirms a higher high, which is a key indicator for trading. The trader should identify higher highs on a chart and take positions when the price breaks out of the higher high, capitalizing on the bullish momentum. The risks associated with trading higher highs include the possibility of a reversal or a bearish trend.
