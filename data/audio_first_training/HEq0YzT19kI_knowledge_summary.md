**Video ID:** HEq0YzT19kI | **Duration:** 14:06 | **Confidence:** 93%

## Core Teaching
CHoCH alone = potential reversal (unconfirmed). Confirmation requires opposite swing structure.

**Bullish → Bearish:** Need LL + LH after CHoCH
**Bearish → Bullish:** Need HH + HL after CHoCH

## Key Rules
- Trade only CONFIRMED CHoCH, not unconfirmed
- Unconfirmed CHoCH may be deep pullback, not reversal
- Final critical piece of structure mapping
- Confirmation sequence prevents premature entries
