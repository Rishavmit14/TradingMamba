## OPTIMAL TRADE ENTRY

*Teaching time: 1.0 min | Words: 160 | Frames: 5 | Generation time: 54.1s*

The "Optimal Trade Entry" concept, as taught by the ICT (Inner Circle Trader), involves identifying the right moment to enter a trade. This is achieved by looking at specific price levels, which are crucial for identifying potential entry points. The term "optimal trade entry" is prominently displayed in the chart, indicating that the focus is on identifying the best time to enter a trade. The chart shows annotations, markings, or highlighted areas that provide additional context or guidance, such as moving averages, Fibonacci ratios, or other technical indicators. The concept is based on the idea of identifying a run above previous days high or below previous days low, which can provide a 47 pip opportunity with a four to one reward to risk. The optimal trade entry is recommended for trading on margin, as it carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. The risk associated with off-exchange foreign currency trading is also discussed, highlighting the need to carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite.
