## Detailed Concept Summaries

### 1. Forex Market Working Principle

The forex market operates 24 hours a day, 5 days a week (closed Saturday and Sunday due to banking holidays). "Smart money" refers to big institutions, big banks, insurance companies, and fund hedgers -- these are the primary market movers. The forex chart is produced by the aggregation of transaction data from small regional banks reporting to state/central banks across four global regions (Asian, London, New York, Sydney), which then feed into a central digital system. Understanding that the chart reflects institutional banking activity (not retail behavior) is foundational to ICT methodology.

### 2. Forex Trading Sessions

The 24-hour trading day is divided into four overlapping sessions, each with distinct characteristics:

- **Asian Session**: Ranging/consolidating behavior. Price moves sideways, building liquidity on both sides of the range. This is the accumulation/liquidity-building phase.
- **London Session**: Trending and volatile. The major directional move of the day typically initiates here. Significantly higher trade volume than Asian session.
- **New York Session**: Continues the trend established by London. Highly volatile for major/USD pairs. Overlaps with London session.
- **Sydney Session**: Market returns to ranging behavior. Low-probability trading environment at the end of the day.

The critical insight is that Asian consolidation builds the liquidity pools that London session targets, and London + New York are the primary trending/trading sessions.

### 3. Bullish Daily Candlestick Formation

A bullish daily candle forms through a specific ICT session sequence:

1. **Asian Session (Open)**: Price opens and consolidates in a range, building liquidity (stop losses) above and below the range.
2. **London Session (Low of Day)**: Price sweeps below the Asian range low (Judas swing), grabbing liquidity, then reverses sharply upward. This creates the lower wick and initiates the candle body.
3. **New York Session (High of Day)**: Price continues trending upward, posting the daily high. This completes the candle body.
4. **Sydney Session (Close)**: Price ranges near the highs, creating the upper wick before the daily candle closes.

**Key rule**: In a bullish day, London session posts the daily low; New York session posts the daily high.

### 4. Bearish Daily Candlestick Formation

The bearish formation is the mirror image:

1. **Asian Session (Open)**: Consolidation and liquidity building.
2. **London Session (High of Day)**: Price sweeps above the Asian range high (Judas swing upside), grabbing liquidity, then reverses sharply downward. This creates the upper wick.
3. **New York Session (Low of Day)**: Price continues trending downward, posting the daily low.
4. **Sydney Session (Close)**: Price ranges near the lows, creating the lower wick.

**Key rule**: In a bearish day, London session posts the daily high; New York session posts the daily low.

### 5. Judas Swing and Liquidity Sweep

The Judas swing is the central manipulation concept linking sessions to trade entries:

- It is a **fake breakout** of the Asian session range that occurs at the start of London session.
- Its purpose is to **sweep liquidity** (stop losses) built during Asian consolidation and **trap retail/breakout traders**.
- In **bullish days**: the Judas swing breaks below the Asian low, then reverses upward.
- In **bearish days**: the Judas swing breaks above the Asian high, then reverses downward.
- The video uses four interchangeable terms: **Judas Swing**, **Liquidity Sweep**, **Liquidity Grab**, and **Manipulation**.
- Traders must NOT trade the initial London breakout of the Asian range -- they must wait for the sweep to complete and the reversal to confirm before entering.

### 6. Candlestick OHLC -- Body vs Wick Meaning

The ICT interpretation of candlestick anatomy gives institutional meaning to each component:

- **Candle Body** = Bank/institutional trading volume. This represents the directional conviction of smart money during the trending London and New York sessions.
- **Candle Wick/Shadow** = Retail trader volume. This represents the manipulation zones where retail traders were trapped (the Judas swing and Sydney session ranging).
- For **bullish candles**: Open is at the bottom of the body, Close at the top; the lower wick represents the London session low-side liquidity sweep.
- For **bearish candles**: Open is at the top of the body, Close at the bottom; the upper wick represents the London session high-side liquidity sweep.

## Key Relationships Between Concepts

The six concepts form a cohesive framework:

1. **Market Structure** (Concept 1) establishes that smart money/institutions drive the market through the banking system.
2. **Session Framework** (Concept 2) provides the time-based structure showing when each type of price behavior occurs.
3. **Candlestick Formation** (Concepts 3 and 4) maps the session framework onto daily candlestick construction, showing exactly which session creates each part of the candle.
4. **Judas Swing** (Concept 5) provides the actionable entry mechanism -- the manipulation at the Asian-to-London transition that creates the daily extreme in the counter-trend direction.
5. **OHLC Anatomy** (Concept 6) ties it all together by attributing the candle body to institutional activity and wicks to retail manipulation.

## Trading Rules Derived

- On bullish bias days: wait for London to sweep Asian lows (Judas swing), then go long.
- On bearish bias days: wait for London to sweep Asian highs (Judas swing), then go short.
- The candle body direction reflects the true institutional intent; wicks reflect manipulation.
- New York session is the highest-volatility session for USD pairs.
- Asian and Sydney sessions are consolidation/ranging -- avoid directional trades during these periods.
