      "llm_summary": "## Definition\nThe Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) is ICT's signature entry methodology that uses Fibonacci retracement levels to identify high-probability entry zones during price retracements. The OTE zone specifically targets the 62% to 79% retracement area, with the 70.5% level considered the 'sweet spot' for entries.\n\n## Rules\n1. Identify a clear swing high and swing low on your timeframe\n2. Apply Fibonacci retracement from swing low to swing high (for longs) or high to low (for shorts)\n3. Wait for price to retrace into the OTE zone (62%-79% retracement)\n4. The 70.5% level is the optimal entry point within this zone\n5. Use a 10-pip stop loss below the swing low for longs (or above swing high for shorts)\n6. Target standard deviation levels (-0.5, -1.0, -1.5, -2.0) for profit taking\n\n## Identification\n- Look for price to 'pierce' a key liquidity level (previous daily high/low)\n- Wait for price to retrace during the New York session\n- Entry confirmation comes when price touches the 70.5% or 79% retracement level\n- Multiple touches of the OTE zone increase confluence\n- The entry candle should show signs of rejection or reversal",

    "fibonacci retracement": {
      "llm_summary": "## Definition\nFibonacci retracement in ICT methodology uses specific levels derived from the Fibonacci sequence to identify potential support and resistance zones. Unlike traditional Fibonacci usage, ICT emphasizes the 62%, 70.5%, and 79% levels as the primary OTE zone, with additional standard deviation extensions for profit targets.\n\n## Rules\n1. Apply Fib from swing low to swing high for bullish setups (0 at low, 100 at high)\n2. Apply Fib from swing high to swing low for bearish setups (0 at high, 100 at low)\n3. Key retracement levels: 62% (0.62), 70.5% (0.705), 79% (0.79)\n4. Extension levels for targets: -0.5 (half standard deviation), -1.0 (one standard deviation), -1.5, -2.0\n5. Use Fib as a framework, not as exact price levels - round to nearby institutional levels\n6. Big figure levels (e.g., 0.6600) often align with Fib extensions\n\n## Identification\n- Identify the most recent significant swing high and swing low\n- The swing should be clear and definitive on the timeframe being analyzed\n- Fib levels provide a 'rough idea' of trade structure, not exact execution prices\n- Always combine with time of day (New York session) for higher probability",

      "llm_summary": "## Definition\nStandard deviation targets in ICT trading represent measured move projections based on the initial price range (swing high to swing low). These extensions project where price is likely to travel once the OTE entry is triggered, providing systematic profit-taking levels.\n\n## Rules\n1. Half standard deviation (-0.5): First partial profit target, represents 50% of the measured range\n2. One standard deviation (-1.0): Second target, equals the full measured range extended from entry\n3. One and a half standard deviation (-1.5): Third target, optional extension\n4. Two standard deviations (-2.0): Maximum extension target, represents 2x the measured range\n5. Round targets to nearby institutional levels (big figures, quarter levels)\n6. Don't demand exact Fib levels - use them as a framework for trade management\n\n## Identification\n- Calculate the range between swing high and swing low\n- Project this range as extensions beyond the OTE zone\n- Standard deviation levels often align with psychological price levels\n- Use these levels for scaling out of positions (partial profits)\n- The big figure level often provides natural resistance/support near standard deviation targets",

    "liquidity": {
      "llm_summary": "## Definition\nLiquidity in ICT methodology refers to clusters of stop-loss orders resting above swing highs (buy-side liquidity) or below swing lows (sell-side liquidity). Smart money targets these pools of orders to fill their large positions before reversing price in the opposite direction.\n\n## Rules\n1. Previous daily highs contain buy-side liquidity (stop losses from shorts)\n2. Previous daily lows contain sell-side liquidity (stop losses from longs)\n3. Price runs liquidity BEFORE establishing the true directional move\n4. A 'modest pierce' above/below the liquidity level is sufficient - no need for a large break\n5. After liquidity is taken, look for price to retrace into the OTE zone\n6. Use old highs/lows as the 'real framework' for trade direction, not just Fib levels\n\n## Identification\n- Mark Tuesday's previous daily high/low on intraday charts\n- Look for price to reach up/down to these levels during London or NY session\n- A slight pierce followed by reversal signals liquidity has been taken\n- Multiple equal highs/lows create stronger liquidity pools\n- Price expansion occurs AFTER liquidity has been absorbed",

This time window provides the highest probability for capturing directional moves as it coincides with institutional order flow and major market participation.\n\n## Rules\n1. Focus trading activity within the New York session time window\n2. Look for setups that develop during this period for highest probability\n3. Price often runs liquidity from the London session during NY open\n4. The retracement into OTE typically occurs within the first 2-3 hours of NY session\n5. Combine time of day with liquidity runs and OTE for confluence\n6. Avoid trading outside of this window unless clear setup develops\n\n## Identification\n- Delineate the New York session on your chart with vertical lines\n- Watch for price to retrace into OTE zone during this time\n- The highest probability entries occur when time, price, and liquidity align\n- NY session provides the 'time of day' component for OTE pattern recognition",

In ICT methodology, these levels often coincide with standard deviation targets and provide reference points for trade management.\n\n## Rules\n1. Big figures often align with standard deviation extension levels\n2. When targeting profits, round to nearby big figure levels\n3. Price tends to expand above/below big figures after taking liquidity\n4. Use big figures as reference for stop placement and profit targets\n5. Don't demand exact Fib level hits - use big figures as practical targets\n6. Institutional orders cluster around these psychological levels\n\n## Identification\n- Identify the nearest big figure level to your calculated standard deviation target\n- Look for price to respect or pierce these levels\n- Big figures like 0.6600 on AUD/USD represent institutional reference points\n- Combine big figure levels with Fibonacci extensions for confluence\n- These levels help translate theoretical Fib levels into practical trading levels",
