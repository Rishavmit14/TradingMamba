The patterns include open, high, low, and close, along with trend lines or support and resistance levels.\n\n2. **Price Levels**: The chart includes specific price levels, such as high and low of each candle, and the close of each candle.

The candle body must close below the valid pullback in sweeping swings, indicating a potential trend reversal.\n\n2. **Trading Application**: ICT recommends trading this pattern by entering when price will give a pullback to the previous high. The market will not wait for an inducement level, and traders can enter anytime when price will give a pullback to this high.\n\n3. **Key Price Levels**: The important price levels to consider are the previous high and the candle body closing below the valid pullback in sweeping swings.

      "llm_summary": "### Higher Highs in the ICT Methodology\n\n#### Definition\nHigher highs refer to instances where the price reaches higher highs, indicating a bullish trend. These are higher than the previous high, which indicates a continuation of the bullish trend.\n\n#### Identification\nHigher highs are identified by the candle body closing above the previous high. This is a key visual characteristic of higher highs. The candle body must be closed above the previous high to confirm a higher high.\n\n#### Trading Application\nIn the context of the Higher Highs concept, the ICT methodology suggests trading higher highs. This involves identifying higher highs on a chart and taking positions when the price breaks out of the higher high. The goal is to capitalize on the bullish momentum created by the higher highs.\n\n#### Key Price Levels\nThe key price levels to consider in the Higher Highs concept are:\n1. The previous high, which is the starting point for the bullish trend.\n2. The higher high, which indicates the continuation of the bullish trend.\n3. The candle body closing above the previous high, which confirms the higher high.\n\n#### Risks\nThere are risks associated with trading higher highs, including the possibility of a reversal or a bearish trend. The trader must be aware of the potential for a reversal and adjust their strategy accordingly.\n\n#### Conclusion\nHigher highs are a key concept in the Higher Highs trading strategy, indicating a bullish trend. The candle body closing above the previous high confirms a higher high, which is a key indicator for trading. The trader should identify higher highs on a chart and take positions when the price breaks out of the higher high, capitalizing on the bullish momentum. The risks associated with trading higher highs include the possibility of a reversal or a bearish trend.",

The **Lower Low** concept is recommended for trading by **ICT (Inner Circle Trader)**, suggesting that it can be a valuable tool for identifying and managing bearish market movements. The **Lower Low** pattern is important for traders as it can provide opportunities for selling or shorting, as the price has already reached a lower low level, which can be a significant support level.

The inducement level is a specific price level that the market has reached and is now considered a significant support or resistance level.\n\n3. **Market Break Swing Higher Low**: The market breaks the swing higher low, which is the swing low that marks the swing high.
