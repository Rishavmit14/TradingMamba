      "llm_summary": "CHoCH Confirmation is the final validation that a trend has truly reversed after an initial CHoCH signal. CHoCH alone indicates POTENTIAL reversal - confirmation requires market to create swing structure in the NEW trend direction. For bullish-to-bearish reversal: need LL (Lower Low) + LH (Lower High) after CHoCH. For bearish-to-bullish reversal: need HH (Higher High) + HL (Higher Low) after CHoCH. Without confirmation, CHoCH may be fake or just a deep pullback. This is the most important final part of structure mapping - separating true reversals from false signals.",

After CHoCH occurs, if market fails to create LL+LH (bearish) or HH+HL (bullish), the CHoCH remains unconfirmed. Unconfirmed CHoCH is dangerous to trade - it may be fake CHoCH or just a deep pullback within the original trend. Many retail traders enter immediately on CHoCH without waiting for confirmation and get stopped out when price resumes the original trend. SMC traders wait for confirmation before entering reversal trades.",
