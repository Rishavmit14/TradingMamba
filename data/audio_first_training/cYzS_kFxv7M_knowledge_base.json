      "llm_summary": "**DEFINITION:**\nOptimal Trade Entry (OTE) in this Episode 14 demonstrates a SHORT setup on GBP/USD with precise swing selection and risk management. ICT emphasizes that swing selection is a 'finesse type thing' requiring practice. The OTE zone (62-79% retracement) provides high-probability entries when combined with order blocks and New York session timing.\n\n**RULES:**\n1. Look for a 'clear price swing' with obvious directional intent during the NY session\n2. The swing should show 'strong willingness to go lower' (for shorts) or higher (for longs)\n3. Apply Fibonacci from swing low (0) to swing high (1.0) for short setups\n4. Enter at the 62% retracement level (1.22468 in this example)\n5. Stop loss above the swing high (20 pips in this trade)\n6. Target Previous Day Low and Fibonacci extensions (-0.5, -1.0)\n7. Aim for minimum 3:1 reward-to-risk ratio\n\n**IDENTIFICATION:**\n1. Entry price: 1.22681 (within the OTE zone)\n2. Swing high (1.0): 1.22846\n3. Swing low (0): 1.22461\n4. 62% retracement: 1.22468\n5. 70.5% retracement: 1.22727\n6. Stop loss: 20 pips above entry\n7. Actual drawdown: Only 7 pips\n8. Target 1 (-0.5): 1.22283\n9. Target 2 (-1.0): 1.22106 (60 pips profit)\n10. Result: 3:1 Reward to Risk achieved",

      "llm_summary": "**DEFINITION:**\nAn Order Block is a consolidation zone or candle where institutional orders were placed before a significant price move. ICT identifies order blocks as the last up-candle before a down move (bearish OB) or the last down-candle before an up move (bullish OB). These zones act as magnets for price to return to.\n\n**RULES:**\n1. Bearish Order Block: The last bullish candle before a significant bearish displacement\n2. Bullish Order Block: The last bearish candle before a significant bullish displacement\n3. Order blocks within the OTE zone provide extra confluence\n4. Price typically returns to the order block before continuing in the displacement direction\n5. The body of the order block candle is the key zone (not the wicks)\n6. Higher timeframe order blocks are more significant\n\n**IDENTIFICATION:**\n1. In this video, ICT highlights the order block at the turning point on British Pound\n2. The order block coincides with the OTE zone for maximum confluence\n3. ICT mentions showing a recording on Twitter highlighting 'this turning point here on the British pound at this order block'\n4. The 'little square block area' represents the consolidation where institutional orders accumulated\n5. Price rallied back into the order block during the NY session, then reversed lower\n6. The order block acted as resistance, confirming the short entry",

      "llm_summary": "**DEFINITION:**\nSwing Selection is the art of choosing the correct swing high and swing low points to anchor your Fibonacci retracement tool. ICT describes this as 'a little bit of a finesse type thing' that requires practice. Proper swing selection is critical for accurate OTE zone identification.\n\n**RULES:**\n1. Select swings that show 'clear indication' of directional intent\n2. Look for swings with 'very quick underlying pressure' in the intended direction\n3. The swing should be formed during or just before the NY session (8:30-11:00 AM)\n4. Avoid choppy, unclear swings - wait for clean price action\n5. The swing high should be a clear peak with lower highs on both sides\n6. The swing low should be a clear trough with higher lows on both sides\n\n**IDENTIFICATION:**\n1. ICT states: 'The selection of this particular swing is, again, it's a little bit of a finesse type thing'\n2. Look for price showing 'strong willingness to go lower' (or higher for longs)\n3. 'There's a very quick underlying pressure for the price to go lower'\n4. Avoid swings with 'a lot of back and forth in price action'\n5. In this example, the swing was selected based on clear bearish intent entering the NY session\n6. The swing high at 1.22846 and swing low at 1.22461 created a clean range for the Fib tool",

      "llm_summary": "**DEFINITION:**\nThe New York Session (NY Kill Zone) runs from 8:30 AM to 11:00 AM New York time. ICT emphasizes this is 'always 8:30 to 11 AM New York time' for OTE setups. This window is when the highest probability setups occur due to institutional participation and economic news releases.\n\n**RULES:**\n1. The NY Kill Zone is strictly 8:30 AM to 11:00 AM EST\n2. Focus your attention during this window - not before, not after\n3. Look for OTE setups that form and execute within this time\n4. Economic releases at 8:30 AM often create the volatility needed for setups\n5. Avoid indicators, trend lines, and moving averages that distract from price action\n6. Clean charts allow you to focus on the price swings during this window\n\n**IDENTIFICATION:**\n1. ICT states: 'We have our New York session again, always 8:30 to 11 AM New York time'\n2. The chart shows a 'New York Session' box marking this exact window\n3. ICT emphasizes: 'You want to be looking at the time of 8:30 to 11'\n4. The OTE entry occurred within this session box on May 27, 2020\n5. The entire trade from entry to 60-pip target completed within the session\n6. ICT advises: 'You don't want to have indicators, trend lines, moving averages... it's going to be a distraction'",

      "llm_summary": "**DEFINITION:**\nPrevious Day Low (PDL) is the lowest price from the prior trading day. It serves as a key reference level for intraday bias and profit targets. ICT marks PDL on charts as a draw on liquidity that price often seeks during the current session.\n\n**RULES:**\n1. Always mark the Previous Day Low before the trading session begins\n2. PDL acts as a draw on liquidity - price is attracted to this level\n3. Use PDL as a logical profit target for short positions\n4. PDL often has sell stops resting below it (from longs)\n5. Price taking out PDL confirms bearish institutional intent\n6. Combine PDL with Fibonacci extensions for multiple targets\n\n**IDENTIFICATION:**\n1. The chart clearly shows 'Previous Day Low' marked as a horizontal line\n2. This level acts as the primary draw for the short trade\n3. The trade targets PDL and the -0.5/-1.0 Fibonacci extensions below it\n4. Entry at 1.22681 with PDL below created clear profit objective\n5. Price eventually traded through PDL, reaching the -1.0 extension at 1.22106\n6. The 60-pip move captured the entire range from OTE to PDL and beyond",

    "reward to risk ratio": {
      "llm_summary": "**DEFINITION:**\nReward to Risk Ratio (R:R) measures the potential profit relative to the risk taken on a trade. ICT emphasizes achieving minimum 3:1 reward-to-risk on OTE trades, meaning you make 3 units for every 1 unit risked. This ensures profitability even with a moderate win rate.\n\n**RULES:**\n1. Aim for minimum 3:1 reward-to-risk on every OTE trade\n2. Calculate risk: Distance from entry to stop loss (in pips)\n3. Calculate reward: Distance from entry to target (in pips)\n4. R:R = Reward / Risk\n5. Only take trades where potential reward significantly exceeds risk\n6. A 3:1 R:R means you can lose 2 out of 3 trades and still be profitable\n\n**IDENTIFICATION:**\n1. The chart displays '3:1 Reward To Risk' prominently\n2. Trade details in this example:\n   - Entry: 1.22681\n   - Stop Loss: 20 pips above entry\n   - Risk: 20 pips\n   - Target (-1.0): 1.22106 (approximately 60 pips)\n   - Reward: 60 pips\n   - R:R = 60/20 = 3:1\n3. Actual drawdown was only 7 pips (marked as '7 Pip DD')\n4. The tight drawdown relative to stop shows precision of OTE entries\n5. First scale at -0.5 (1.22283) captured 40+ pips\n6. Full target at -1.0 captured the full 60 pips (3:1)",

      "llm_summary": "**DEFINITION:**\nFibonacci Extensions are levels projected beyond the initial swing range, used as profit targets. ICT uses extensions at -0.5, -1.0, -1.5, and -2.0 to identify where price is likely to travel after reversing from the OTE zone.\n\n**RULES:**\n1. Extensions project below the swing low (for shorts) or above the swing high (for longs)\n2. -0.5 extension: First logical profit target (partial take profit)\n3. -1.0 extension: Standard full target (100% extension of the swing)\n4. -1.5 and -2.0: Extended targets for strong momentum moves\n5. Use extensions in conjunction with Previous Day High/Low for confluence\n6. Scale out at each extension level to lock in profits\n\n**IDENTIFICATION:**\n1. Swing range: 1.22846 (high) to 1.22461 (low) = 38.5 pips\n2. 0 level: 1.22461 (swing low / first target)\n3. -0.5 level: 1.22283 (shown as first scale target)\n4. -1.0 level: 1.22106 (shown as '60 Pips' target)\n5. Price traded through all extension levels after the OTE entry\n6. The 60-pip label confirms the distance from entry to -1.0 extension\n7. Extensions provided clear, objective profit targets rather than guessing",

This allows you to focus purely on price action, time of day, and key levels without visual distractions that cloud judgment.\n\n**RULES:**\n1. Remove all indicators from your charts\n2. Remove trend lines and moving averages\n3. Focus only on: Price candles, horizontal levels, Fibonacci, and session boxes\n4. Indicators are 'going to be a distraction' from pure price action\n5. Clean charts help you identify swing points and order blocks more clearly\n6. Time and price are the only inputs needed for OTE trading\n\n**IDENTIFICATION:**\n1. ICT states: 'That's why you don't want to have indicators, you don't want to have trend lines, moving averages, none of that stuff because it's going to be a distraction'\n2. The chart examples show only: Price candles, Fibonacci levels, session box, and Previous Day Low\n3. No RSI, MACD, Stochastic, or other indicators visible\n4. This clean approach allows focus on the OTE zone and order block\n5. ICT emphasizes: 'When you're looking at your chart, it's going to look like this'\n6.
