## Overview

This video provides a comprehensive side-by-side comparison of three fundamental Smart Money Concepts (SMC): **Liquidity Sweep**, **Break of Structure (BOS)**, and **Swing High/Low**. The instructor uses a three-rule framework applied in parallel across all three concepts to show exactly how they differ. The rules are presented for bullish market structure and are stated to be 100% applicable to bearish structure by mirroring directions. The video includes candlestick chart diagrams for each concept and concludes with a real market example on AUDUSD 4H.

## Concepts Extracted: 7

---

### 1. Break of Structure (BOS)

A validated structural move where price creates a new high (bullish) or new low (bearish) after fulfilling all three SMC rules. BOS confirms trend continuation.

**Three Rules for BOS (Bullish):**
- **Rule 1 (Inducement):** Market MUST take out the inducement level
- **Rule 2 (Candle at Inducement):** Both candle wick sweep AND candle body close below inducement are valid
- **Rule 3 (Previous High):** Candle body MUST close above the previous high

BOS has the most lenient inducement interaction requirement of the three concepts (accepts both wick and body).

---

### 2. Liquidity Sweep

A false breakout where price moves beyond a previous high/low using only the candle wick, without the body closing beyond the level. Represents smart money grabbing stop-loss liquidity.

**Three Rules for Liquidity Sweep (Bullish):**
- **Rule 1 (Inducement):** Inducement is NOT compulsory; liquidity sweeps are independent from inducement
- **Rule 2 (Candle at Inducement):** Only candle wick counts; body close is NOT valid
- **Rule 3 (Previous High):** Only candle wick above the high counts; body close above the high INVALIDATES the liquidity sweep

Key differentiator: wick-only interaction at all levels, with the body closing back on the original side.

---

### 3. Swing High and Swing Low

The highest-quality structural pivot points used for true structure mapping. These define HH/HL (bullish) or LH/LL (bearish) and have the strictest validation criteria.

**Three Rules for Swing High/Low (Bullish):**
- **Rule 1 (Inducement):** Market MUST take out the inducement level
- **Rule 2 (Candle at Inducement):** ONLY candle body close below inducement is valid; wick sweep is INVALID
- **Rule 3 (Previous High):** Candle body MUST close above the previous high

The critical differentiator from BOS is Rule 2: swing highs require body close below inducement, while BOS accepts either wick or body.

### 4. Three SMC Rules Framework

The master classification system for any price move at a structural level. All three rules are applied sequentially to classify the move:

| Rule | Liquidity Sweep | Break of Structure | Swing High/Low |
|------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **1. Inducement** | Not compulsory | Must take out IDM | Must take out IDM |
| **2. Candle at IDM** | Wick only; body invalid | Wick OR body valid | Body only; wick invalid |
| **3. Candle at Prev High** | Wick only; body invalidates | Body must close above | Body must close above |

---

### 5. Inducement Role in Structure Classification

Inducement (IDM) serves as the first filter in the three-rule framework:
- **Liquidity Sweep:** Independent from inducement; IDM not required
- **BOS:** IDM must be taken out; wick or body interaction both valid
- **Swing High/Low:** IDM must be taken out AND candle body must close below it

Quick filter: No IDM taken = can only be liquidity sweep. IDM swept by wick only = can be BOS but not swing high. IDM closed below by body = could be any of the three (check further rules).

---

### 6. Candle Body vs Wick Validation

The single most important differentiator across all three concepts. The body-vs-wick distinction applies at two levels:

**At Inducement Level:**
- Liquidity Sweep = wick only
- BOS = wick or body (lenient)
- Swing High/Low = body only (strict)

**At Previous High/Low:**
- Liquidity Sweep = wick only (body invalidates)
- BOS = body must close beyond
- Swing High/Low = body must close beyond

Pattern: Liquidity Sweep is wick-only at both levels. BOS is lenient at inducement, strict at previous high. Swing High/Low is strict at both levels.

---

### 7. BOS vs Swing High Relationship

The key hierarchical insight: **Every Swing High is also a Break of Structure, but NOT every Break of Structure is a Swing High.**

This is because:
- Rules 1 and 3 are identical for both BOS and Swing High
- Rule 2 differs: BOS accepts wick or body at inducement; Swing High requires body only
- When candle body closes below inducement, the move satisfies BOTH BOS and Swing High rules simultaneously
- When candle wick only sweeps inducement, the move is BOS but NOT a swing high

On the AUDUSD 4H real chart example, the instructor demonstrates labeling highs as Liquidity Sweep, BOS, or Swing High (HH) based on these rules.

## Key Takeaway

The entire video distills into one decision framework: when price approaches a previous high or low, check (1) whether inducement was taken out, (2) how the candle interacted with inducement (wick vs body), and (3) whether the candle body closed beyond the previous high/low. These three checks classify the move as a Liquidity Sweep, BOS, or valid Swing High/Low with no ambiguity.
