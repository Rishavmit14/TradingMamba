      "llm_summary": "## Definition\nThe Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) is ICT's primary entry model that uses Fibonacci retracement levels between 62% and 79% to identify high-probability trade entry zones. This video (OTE #19) demonstrates the concept on USD/JPY with a specific focus on combining OTE with market structure and bias.\n\n## Rules\n1. **Establish bias first**: Before looking for OTE, determine if the market is bullish or bearish using higher timeframe analysis\n2. **Identify the swing**: For bullish bias, find swing low to swing high; for bearish, find swing high to swing low\n3. **OTE zone**: The 62%-79% Fibonacci retracement zone is where you seek entries\n4. **Confirmation candle**: Wait for price to enter the zone and show rejection (wick into zone, body closes outside)\n5. **Kill zone alignment**: OTE should form during New York session for highest probability\n\n## Identification\n- USD/JPY 5-minute chart displayed\n- Swing low at 108.628 (100% level)\n- Swing high at 108.769 (0% level)\n- OTE entry zone: 62% at 108.670, 70.5% at 108.658, 79% near swing low\n- Entry shown at 108.70 with 3 pips drawdown\n- Target: +28 pips at -2 extension (109.051)\n- 10 pip stop loss demonstrated\n\n## Trading Application\n- Entry: Limit order at 62% level (108.70) or wait for confirmation\n- Stop Loss: 10 pips below entry (below swing low at 108.628)\n- Take Profit 1: -1.0 extension at 108.910 (+20 pips)\n- Take Profit 2: -1.5 extension at 108.981 (+25 pips)\n- Take Profit 3: -2.0 extension at 109.051 (+28 pips)\n- Minimum 2.8:1 reward to risk demonstrated",

      "llm_summary": "## Definition\nMarket structure bias refers to the directional tendency of the market based on the pattern of higher highs and higher lows (bullish) or lower highs and lower lows (bearish). ICT emphasizes that bias must be established BEFORE looking for OTE setups.\n\n## Rules\n1. **Higher timeframe first**: Establish bias on daily or 4-hour chart before dropping to entry timeframe\n2. **Structure breaks**: A bullish bias requires price to break a previous high (BOS - Break of Structure)\n3. **Continuation**: OTE trades should be in the direction of the established bias\n4. **Invalidation**: Bias changes when structure breaks in the opposite direction\n\n## Identification\n- Video shows price broke above a previous high, establishing bullish bias\n- This high break confirms the direction for OTE entry\n- ICT's High Probability Scalping Series referenced for more detail on bias determination\n- The swing that forms the OTE setup follows the structure break\n\n## Trading Application\n- Never take OTE entries against the bias\n- Use higher timeframes (4H, Daily) to establish direction\n- Drop to lower timeframe (5M, 15M) only after bias is confirmed\n- The structure break (BOS) is your permission to look for OTE entries",

These represent buy-side liquidity pools where retail traders place stop losses.\n\n## Rules\n1. **Liquidity magnet**: Equal highs attract price because stop losses cluster above them\n2. **Target, not entry**: Equal highs are typically targets, not entry zones\n3. **Before OTE**: Price often sweeps equal highs to grab liquidity before retracing to OTE\n4. **Confluence**: Equal highs near Fibonacci extensions strengthen the target\n\n## Identification\n- Look for two or more swing highs at the same level\n- Draw a horizontal line connecting these highs\n- In this video context: Equal highs serve as the draw on liquidity above current price\n- Price will likely run these highs before any significant reversal\n\n## Trading Application\n- Use equal highs as profit targets for long positions\n- After equal highs are swept, look for OTE short setups\n- Do not blindly short equal highs - wait for OTE confirmation\n- Combine with session timing for higher probability",
