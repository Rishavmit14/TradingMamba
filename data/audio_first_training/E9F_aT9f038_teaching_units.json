And so by me showing you examples of this particular pattern and the signatures that generally repeat with it, you're going to see how you can start doing this on your own. And then if you have the ability to watch it live, you'll see many times it's formation and then you'll grow in your confidence to paper trade it, then demo trade it. And if you feel inclined to do so, if you've shown six months of consistency, you want to dabble with a very, very small amount of money, live money, nothing big, nothing grandiose. The smallest amount of money you can open up an account with and then trade the smallest little lot sizes possible. And then again, just follow the same protocols and procedures that would otherwise lead to your trust in finding it in price action. You determine that on your own. I don't ever tell anybody say, okay, go trade with life money because there's a lot of responsibility in that. And legally, I can't tell you to do that.

One, it goes through the previous days high and this explodes and never gives you a chance to trade and that's just a missed opportunity. And there's nothing you can do about it. There's no reason to get upset about it. There's no reason to go online and complain to other people how you missed that trade or you suck or you're never going to get this. Never do that because you're actually giving yourself negative reinforcement and your subconscious will remember that. And every trade you take after that trade will be plagued by that negative narrative that you've given yourself that you suck. You're never going to get this. So every time you actually muster up the courage to get and actually execute, you're going to be scared. You're going to be constantly revved up. You're going to be in a constant state of stress and anxiety versus just following the method that you've adopted and focusing on what price is doing.

When you understand this pattern, you can mark out your previous days highs and lows and if there is a very discernible, clear, unambiguous directional bias that lends well to one particular currency or two over the other basket of currencies that you follow, then that means that you've very easily filtered out all the other currencies so now you're going to focus on maybe one or two for that particular day and then wait to see if it trades to and through the previous days high if it's bullish or below the previous days low if you're bearish.",

Don't be mad you only want something that makes sense and a time where you anticipate it occurring. This is discipline this is focusing on a rule based premise and filing your price action model. This is the way professional traders do it they don't get lax in their rules and say okay well it was good the last 12 times I did it but this time I just feel lucky and I'm just going to do things slightly different. They don't do that okay generally if you have a model or trading plan you want to stick to the rules and that way you're not going to be confused when things go awry. It's just simply a losing trade and you're not going to be able to avoid every instance of that occurring. Everyone takes losses I take losses I have lost money okay you're going to lose money you can't avoid it it's absolutely going to happen if you put live money in here you're going to lose money.

That volume is no longer available and through noon to 1 o'clock in the afternoon that's generally the New York lunch and it can be quiet during those times. You only want to be looking for this pattern up to 11 o'clock in the morning. After 11 o'clock it can form but it's something other than what I'm teaching here and that's not important. The point is you want to see this pattern form during this time of day with the bias determined by what you determine on your daily chart. Do you think the previous days high is going to be taken out or the previous days low is taken out? And here's the thing, the beautiful thing really is many times you don't even need a bias. You just wait for the chart to show you what it's done. Does it take out the previous days high or the previous days low? At this time of day what has it done?
