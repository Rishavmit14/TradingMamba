CHoCH occurs when market breaks the current strong swing point in the opposite direction of the trend. In bullish market, CHoCH happens when price breaks below the current strong swing Higher Low (HL). In bearish market, CHoCH happens when price breaks above the current strong swing Lower High (LH). The key difference between retail and SMC approach is that SMC traders use inducement-based structure mapping to identify VALID swing points, avoiding false CHoCH signals that trap retail traders. CHoCH is timeframe-specific - each timeframe has its own CHoCH level based on its own swing points.",
