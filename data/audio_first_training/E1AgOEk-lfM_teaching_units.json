    "text": "Trend reversal mean change of character. As per this rule, conventional smart money or retail traders will consider this reversal zone as price break the major higher low, key level. Now, retail trader will start selling here consider it market reversal. But true smart money traders will look to buy here who know that what big insiditutions and banks are actually trying to do and how they are trying to trap less informed traders. Why smart money will be buying here even though it looks like a shock? I mean reversal point. Now, let me disclose this biggest secret in smart money trading concept. Take notes, when market move from low to high in an impulse swing, it's mean a swing without a pullback, then low of the swing will act as inducement. What does it mean? It's mean then we will not mark this higher low as a key support level. This is actually act as inducement as per this rule.",

Now, if this is our inducement, so what we have to do? Being true SMC traders, we will be looking to buy here as our trend is bullish.
