      "llm_summary": "## Definition\nDaily Timeframe OTE involves using the daily chart to establish directional bias and identify the dealing range (swing high to swing low), then dropping to lower timeframes for precise entry execution. This multi-timeframe approach ensures alignment with the larger trend while optimizing entry timing.\n\n## Rules\n1. Start analysis on the daily chart to identify the primary trend direction\n2. Identify the most recent significant swing high and swing low on the daily timeframe\n3. Apply Fibonacci retracement from daily swing low to daily swing high (for bullish bias)\n4. The daily range provides the framework for potential price expansion\n5. Drop to 5-minute chart during New York session for precise OTE entry\n6. Daily chart determines WHERE to trade, lower timeframe determines WHEN to enter\n\n## Identification\n- Open the daily chart and locate the most recent swing structure\n- The previous day's range serves as the primary reference (high to low)\n- Determine if the daily bias is bullish (expecting run above previous day's high) or bearish\n- Once daily bias is established, monitor lower timeframes for OTE entry during NY session\n- Daily chart swing points define the boundaries for Fibonacci application",

This range serves as a critical reference for trade planning, providing both liquidity targets (previous day's high for longs, low for shorts) and context for Fibonacci application.\n\n## Rules\n1. Mark the previous day's high and low on your chart before the trading day begins\n2. The previous day's high represents buy-side liquidity (target for longs)\n3. The previous day's low represents sell-side liquidity (target for shorts)\n4. Use the previous day's range as the framework for Fibonacci retracement\n5. Price running above/below the previous day's range signals liquidity has been taken\n6. The range can be used to define the dealing range for standard deviation targets\n\n## Identification\n- On USD/JPY, the example shows previous day's range from low to high (106.657 high)\n- Draw horizontal lines at both previous day's high and low\n- This range is 'defined from here to here' as ICT states\n- The range provides context for where price is likely to expand\n- New York session setups often target the previous day's high or low",

      "llm_summary": "## Definition\nThe 10-pip stop loss is ICT's standard risk parameter for the OTE model. By entering at the 62% retracement level and placing the stop loss below the swing low (for longs) or above the swing high (for shorts), the typical risk is approximately 10 pips on most forex pairs.\n\n## Rules\n1. Calculate the stop distance from entry at 62% to the swing low/high\n2. The standard OTE model uses a 10-pip stop as the benchmark\n3. Stop placement is at or beyond the swing low (for longs) to avoid premature stopouts\n4. Round to nearest 5 pipettes for practical execution (e.g., 106.215 instead of 106.214)\n5. The stop distance should allow for minor price wicks while protecting capital\n6. If the calculated stop exceeds 15 pips, the setup may not be optimal\n\n## Identification\n- Example: Entry at 106.315, Stop at 106.215 = exactly 10 pips risk\n- The stop is placed at or below the swing low that defines the OTE zone\n- Calculate: Entry price - Stop price = Risk in pips\n- Ensure the risk/reward ratio meets minimum criteria (1:1.5 or better for first target)\n- Adjust position size based on the 10-pip stop to maintain proper risk management",

      "llm_summary": "## Definition\nScaling profit targets is a systematic approach to taking partial profits at predetermined price levels as the trade moves in favor. The ICT OTE model uses three scaling levels: first at the old range high (minimum 15 pips), second at a higher extension, and third above the previous day's high.\n\n## Rules\n1. First scaling: Target the old high that makes the range (approximately 15 pips from entry)\n2. This first target 'meets our minimum criteria for the first scaling'\n3. Second scaling: Around 25 pips, still below previous day's high\n4. Third scaling: Above the previous day's high at the Fib -10 level (approximately 35 pips)\n5. Each scaling level allows taking partial profits while leaving runners for larger moves\n6. The -10 level on the Fib is 'nice because it's above the previous day's high'\n\n## Identification\n- Mark the old range high as your first target (e.g., 15 pips from entry)\n- Second target at the next Fib extension (e.g., 25 pips)\n- Third target above the liquidity level (previous day's high)\n- Each scaling level should provide meaningful profit (minimum 15 pips for first)\n- Calculate potential profit at each level before entering the trade",

This is the precise window for OTE pattern recognition setups, providing the 'time of day' component that combines with price and liquidity for high-probability trades.\n\n## Rules\n1. Focus trading activity between 8:30 AM and 11:00 AM New York time\n2. Mark vertical lines on your chart to delineate this session\n3. OTE entries should occur within this time window\n4. Price retracing into OTE zone during this window confirms the setup\n5. Avoid trading outside these hours unless exceptional setup develops\n6. This timing aligns with institutional order flow and provides optimal probability\n\n## Identification\n- Draw vertical lines at 8:30 AM NY and 11:00 AM NY on your chart\n- As ICT states: 'from 8:30 AM New York time to 11:00 AM New York time'\n- Monitor price action specifically within these boundaries\n- Setups developing outside this window have lower probability\n- The session timing provides the third confluence factor (price, liquidity, time)",

When bullish, traders target these pools of orders as profit objectives, as price is attracted to run above these levels before potentially reversing.\n\n## Rules\n1. Previous day's high contains clustered buy-side liquidity\n2. When bullish, use the previous day's high as your primary profit target\n3. 'We're expecting a run above the previous day's high' when daily bias is bullish\n4. Look for a reason to get long to target this high\n5. Price running above the previous day's high signals buy-side liquidity has been taken\n6. Third scaling target should be above this liquidity level\n\n## Identification\n- Mark the previous day's high (e.g., 106.657 on USD/JPY)\n- This level represents clustered stop losses from shorts\n- When daily bias is bullish, this becomes your liquidity target\n- Price should expand toward this level after OTE entry\n- Scaling targets should be structured around reaching this liquidity pool",

Entry, stop, and first target are all visible on 5-minute chart\n6. The 5-minute provides granular price action for optimal entry timing\n\n## Identification\n- Watch the 5-minute chart during 8:30 AM - 11:00 AM NY session\n- Price should drop down into the OTE zone (62%, 70.5%, 79%)\n- 'You can see how it probably drops down into it here' on the intraday chart\n- Entry confirmed when price touches the 62% level on 5-minute\n- Use 5-minute candle closes for confirmation of entry validity",

Locate potential OTE entry zones\n5. Calculate entry, stop, and target levels independently\n6. Compare your analysis with ICT's explanation to identify gaps in understanding\n\n## Identification\n- 'Pause the video and study what you think you see here'\n- Look for: swing high/low, previous day's range, liquidity levels\n- Apply Fib from appropriate swing points\n- Identify entry at 62%, stop below swing low, targets at extensions\n- Self-assess: did you identify the same setup as ICT?\n- This practice builds pattern recognition muscle memory over time",
