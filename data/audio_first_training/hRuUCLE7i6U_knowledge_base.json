      "llm_summary": "SMC Candlestick Analysis differs from traditional candlestick patterns. Instead of memorizing hundreds of patterns (doji, hammer, engulfing, etc.), SMC focuses on: 1) Candle body vs wick analysis for liquidity sweeps, 2) Candle close position relative to structure levels, 3) Candle that creates BOS/CHoCH, 4) Candle that forms Order Blocks. The emphasis is on WHERE candles appear in market structure and WHAT they represent (institutional activity) rather than pattern names. Body close validation is most critical element.",
