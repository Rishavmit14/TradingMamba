      "llm_summary": "### Forex Market Working Principle\n\n#### Definition\nThe forex market operates on a 24-hours-a-day, 5-days-a-week basis (24/5), driven by the global banking system. The term 'smart money' refers to the major market participants: big institutions, big banks, insurance companies, and fund hedgers (hedge funds). The market is closed on Saturday and Sunday because the banking system is closed on weekends. The forex chart we see is the aggregate digital record of all transaction data reported from banking systems across the four major global regions.\n\n#### Identification\nThe forex market structure is built from the bottom up: small regional banks in each geography (Asian, London, New York, Sydney) report their transaction data to their respective state/central banks. These central banks then report to a larger global institution, which aggregates and records the data into a digital system. This aggregated data is what produces the forex trading chart that traders analyze. The visual schematic shows four regional banking clusters (Asian in green, London in pink, New York in yellow, Sydney in purple), each flowing through a central bank icon to a digital network, which then feeds into a single centralized institution, ultimately producing the candlestick chart.\n\n#### Trading Application\nUnderstanding this principle is foundational: the forex chart reflects institutional and banking activity, not retail trader behavior. Smart money (institutions) drives the market. Retail traders must learn to read the chart through the lens of institutional order flow rather than retail indicators. The 24/5 schedule means traders must plan around weekend gaps and understand that continuous session overlap keeps the market moving throughout the trading week.",

      "llm_summary": "### Forex Trading Sessions\n\n#### Definition\nThe forex market operates continuously for 24 hours through four overlapping trading sessions: Asian, London, New York, and Sydney. Each session has a distinct character and role in the daily price action cycle. The trading day begins with the Asian session, followed by the London session which overlaps with Asian, then the New York session which overlaps with London, and finally the Sydney session which overlaps with New York to complete the 24-hour cycle.\n\n#### Identification\nEach session is visually represented as a colored horizontal bar on a 00:00 to 24:00 timeline, with overlapping zones where two sessions run simultaneously. The key behavioral characteristics of each session are:\n- **Asian Session**: Market is ranging/consolidating. Price moves sideways within a defined range, building liquidity on both sides (highs and lows of the range). This is the accumulation phase.\n- **London Session**: Market becomes trending and volatile. This is where the major directional move of the day typically initiates. London session has significantly higher trade volume than Asian session.\n- **New York Session**: Market continues trending, especially volatile for major/USD pairs. New York overlaps with London and continues the directional bias established by London.\n- **Sydney Session**: Market returns to ranging behavior at the end of the trading day, consolidating before the next Asian session begins.\n\n#### Trading Application\nThe session framework is critical for intraday trading. Traders should recognize that Asian session consolidation builds the liquidity pools that London session will target. The trending nature of London and New York sessions is where the highest-probability directional trades occur. New York session is particularly important for USD pairs due to high volatility. Sydney session is a low-probability trading environment similar to Asian session. Understanding session overlap zones helps identify when volatility transitions occur.",

    "bullish_daily_candlestick_formation": {
      "llm_summary": "### Bullish Daily Candlestick Formation\n\n#### Definition\nA bullish daily candlestick is not simply a green candle -- it is formed through a specific sequence of price action across the four trading sessions within a single 24-hour period. The formation follows a precise ICT framework: the Asian session opens and consolidates (creating the open price and building liquidity), the London session sweeps the Asian low-side liquidity and posts the daily low, then price reverses and trends upward through London and New York sessions (creating the candle body), the New York session posts the daily high, and the Sydney session ranges near the highs (creating the upper wick) before the candle closes.\n\n#### Identification\nOn the visual diagram, the bullish candlestick formation shows: (1) Asian session as a zigzag ranging pattern near the open price with '$$$' marking liquidity above and below the range; (2) London session beginning with a sharp drop below the Asian range low (the liquidity sweep / Judas swing) which forms the lower wick, then a strong reversal upward that creates the lower portion of the candle body; (3) New York session continuing the upward trend to post the high of the day, forming the upper portion of the candle body; (4) Sydney session showing a small zigzag ranging pattern near the highs, creating the upper wick. The resulting daily candlestick on the right side of the diagram shows a bullish candle with a lower wick (London manipulation), a large body (London + New York trending), and a small upper wick (Sydney ranging).\n\n#### Trading Application\nFor bullish days, the key trade setup is to wait for the London session to sweep the Asian session low (Judas swing), then enter long after the reversal. The daily low is posted in London session -- this is the optimal entry zone. The candle body represents the institutional/bank trading volume moving price directionally from London through New York. Traders should anticipate that the high of the day will be posted during New York session. The practical rule: on bullish bias days, look for London session to take out Asian lows before going long.",

      "llm_summary": "### Bearish Daily Candlestick Formation\n\n#### Definition\nA bearish daily candlestick forms through the mirror-image sequence of the bullish formation. The Asian session opens and consolidates (building liquidity on both sides), the London session sweeps the Asian high-side liquidity and posts the daily high (Judas swing to the upside), then price reverses sharply downward and trends lower through London and New York sessions (creating the candle body), the New York session posts the daily low, and the Sydney session ranges near the lows before the candle closes.\n\n#### Identification\nOn the visual diagram, the bearish candlestick formation shows: (1) Asian session as a zigzag consolidation near the open with '$$$' marking liquidity pools above and below; (2) London session beginning with a spike above the Asian range high (the upside liquidity sweep / Judas swing labeled as 'Liquidity Sweep / Liquidity Grab / Manipulation / Judas Swing') which forms the upper wick, followed by a sharp reversal downward creating the upper portion of the bearish candle body; (3) New York session continuing the downward trend to post the low of the day, forming the lower portion of the candle body; (4) Sydney session showing ranging behavior near the lows, creating the lower wick. The resulting daily candlestick is bearish (red) with an upper wick (London manipulation), a large red body (London + New York trending down), and a small lower wick (Sydney ranging).\n\n#### Trading Application\nFor bearish days, the key trade setup is to wait for the London session to sweep the Asian session high (Judas swing to upside), then enter short after the reversal. The daily high is posted in London session -- this is the optimal entry zone for shorts. Traders should anticipate that the low of the day will be posted during New York session, which serves as the take-profit target zone. The practical rule: on bearish bias days, look for London session to take out Asian highs before going short.",

    "judas_swing_and_liquidity_sweep": {
      "llm_summary": "### Judas Swing and Liquidity Sweep\n\n#### Definition\nThe Judas swing is a deceptive price movement that occurs at the beginning of the London session, designed to trap retail and breakout traders. It is a fake directional move that sweeps the liquidity built up during the Asian session consolidation before the market reverses and moves in the true intended direction. The term 'Judas' refers to the betrayal -- the initial move looks like a legitimate breakout but is actually a manipulation by smart money to grab liquidity. The video also uses the terms 'liquidity sweep', 'liquidity grab', and 'manipulation' interchangeably with Judas swing.\n\n#### Identification\nThe Judas swing is identified by the following sequence: (1) Asian session consolidates in a range, building equal liquidity (marked as '$$') on both the high and low sides of the range; (2) At the start of London session, price breaks out of the Asian range in the OPPOSITE direction of the true daily trend -- in a bullish day, it breaks below the Asian low; in a bearish day, it breaks above the Asian high; (3) After sweeping the liquidity (stop losses of traders positioned within the Asian range), price sharply reverses in the true trending direction. On the chart diagrams, the Judas swing is circled and labeled, occurring precisely at the transition from Asian to London session.\n\n#### Trading Application\nThe Judas swing is the single most important concept for daily trade timing in ICT methodology. Traders must NOT trade the initial London session breakout of the Asian range, as this is the trap/manipulation move. Instead, traders should wait for the sweep to complete and the reversal to begin before entering in the true direction. In bullish markets: the Judas swing sweeps Asian lows, then reverses up -- enter long after the reversal. In bearish markets: the Judas swing sweeps Asian highs, then reverses down -- enter short after the reversal. This concept directly links the session structure to actionable trade entries.",

    "candlestick_ohlc_body_vs_wick": {
      "llm_summary": "### Candlestick OHLC -- Body vs Wick Meaning\n\n#### Definition\nEvery candlestick has four key price values: Open, High, Low, and Close (OHLC). The candle body represents the range between the open and close prices. The wicks (also called shadows) extend from the body to the high and low of the candle. In ICT methodology, the candle body and wick have a deeper institutional meaning: the candle body represents bank trading volume (institutional/smart money activity), while the candle wick or shadow represents retail trader volume (the manipulated portion of price action).\n\n#### Identification\nThe visual diagram shows three candlestick illustrations side by side: (1) A generic candlestick with labels showing 'Candle Body (Bank Trading)' for the filled center portion and 'Candle Wick / Shadow (Retail Trading)' for both the upper and lower extensions; (2) A bullish candle (purple) with Open at the bottom of the body, Close at the top, Low at the bottom of the lower wick, and High at the top of the upper wick; (3) A bearish candle (red) with Open at the top of the body, Close at the bottom, High at the top of the upper wick, and Low at the bottom of the lower wick. For bullish candles, the low (bottom of wick) is on the downside because London session posts the daily low via the Judas swing. For bearish candles, the high (top of wick) is the London session manipulation to the upside.\n\n#### Trading Application\nTraders should focus on the candle body as the representation of institutional intent -- the body shows where smart money moved price with conviction. The wicks represent manipulation zones where retail traders were trapped. When analyzing daily candlesticks, the lower wick of a bullish candle corresponds to the London session liquidity sweep (Judas swing below Asian range), and the upper wick of a bearish candle corresponds to the London session liquidity sweep above the Asian range. Understanding this distinction helps traders avoid being trapped in wick zones and instead trade with the body (institutional direction).",
