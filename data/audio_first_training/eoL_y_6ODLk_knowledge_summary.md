## Core Teaching: 4 Rules to Distinguish Valid from Fake CHoCH

### Rule 1: Weak Swing Point = Fake CHoCH
- Swing created by sweeping candle is WEAK
- Sweeping candle's strength consumed by liquidity sweep
- Breaking weak swing = fake CHoCH

### Rule 2: Creates ENG LIQ = Fake CHoCH
- Swing break followed by ENG LIQ zone (consolidation, trendlines)
- Smart Money hunts ENG LIQ then resumes trend
- Purpose: trap retail, not reverse trend

### Rule 3: No Inducement = Fake CHoCH
- Valid CHoCH must take inducement first
- CHoCH without inducement break violates SMC rules
- Fake signal - price returns for inducement later

### Rule 4: Lower TF Swing = Higher TF Inducement = Fake CHoCH
- M15 swing may be H4 inducement
- Breaking it on M15 appears as CHoCH but is H4 inducement hunt
- Multi-timeframe analysis required

## Validation Checklist
ALL 4 must pass:
- ✓ Strong swing (not weak/sweeping)
- ✓ Does NOT create ENG LIQ
- ✓ Inducement taken first
- ✓ Not higher TF inducement
