## LIQUIDITY

*Teaching time: 1.8 min | Words: 308 | Frames: 10 | Generation time: 59.3s*

The "LIQUIDITY" concept in the context of the Inner Circle Trader methodology involves identifying and trading in areas where high and low price points are created by sweeping candles. These sweeping candles are part of a liquidity sweep, which is a specific pattern where only one candle wicks above the previous high. The key visual characteristics of liquidity sweep areas include:

1. **Swing Points**: Swing points are identified by specific price levels and annotations, such as "Weak Swing Point" and "Swing Point".
2. **Identification**: To spot liquidity sweep areas, look for sweeping candles that wick above the previous high.
3. **Trading Application**: ICT recommends trading in these areas, as they are considered weak swing points and should not be used for optimal entry points.
4. **Key Price Levels**: The important price levels in liquidity sweep areas are those where the sweeping candle wicks above the previous high.
5. **Leveraged nature**: The leverage nature of forex trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds. This can either work in your favor or against you, depending on the direction of the market.

In summary, liquidity sweep areas are identified by sweeping candles that wick above the previous high, and traders should focus on these areas for potential trading opportunities.

6. **Key Price Levels**: The important price levels to consider are the high and low points, which are weak swing points, and the inducement level, which is the price taken out of the inducement level and moved higher.

7. **Risk Management**: The Inner Circle Trader emphasizes the importance of risk management, suggesting that using an Internet-based trading system can increase the risk associated with using such systems.
