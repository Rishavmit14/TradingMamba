## FIBONACCI

*Teaching time: 0.4 min | Words: 90 | Frames: 2 | Generation time: 34.9s*

The "FIBONACCI" concept, as taught by the ICT (Inner Circle Trader), refers to a specific trading pattern identified on a chart. The pattern involves a trendline or moving average, which is a common indicator used in technical analysis. The chart also features several candlestick patterns, which are used to identify price action and potential support or resistance levels.

The ICT recommends trading this pattern by identifying the low of the previous day, the low of the current trading session, and the high of the previous day. The price is at or near these levels, which are important price levels to consider. The pattern is particularly useful for identifying potential support or resistance levels, as it can indicate where the market is seeking to find liquidity.

The "FIBONACCI" concept is based on the Fibonacci sequence, a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. In trading, the Fibonacci sequence can be used to identify potential retracement levels, where the market retraces a portion of its previous move. The "FIBONACCI" pattern can be used to identify these retracement levels, which can be important for traders looking to enter or exit trades.

**LIQUIDITY** is a term used in trading to describe the availability of buying and selling opportunities in a market. It refers to the ease with which a large number of buyers and sellers can enter and exit the market at a given price level. In the context of the provided chart analysis, liquidity can be identified by the presence of several bullish indicators, such as "OB Inside OTE" patterns, "+50 handles on 2nd Partial" patterns, "+75 handles on 3rd Partial" patterns, and "OFF" patterns, which are all bullish indicators. These patterns indicate that there is a high level of demand and supply in the market, which can lead to increased liquidity. The chart shows a bearish market structure, with the bearish trend visible, and several "OB Inside OTE" patterns, which are bullish indicators, supporting the presence of liquidity.
