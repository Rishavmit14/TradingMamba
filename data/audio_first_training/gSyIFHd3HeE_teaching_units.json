Well, this is easy to understand and digest this concept for bullish trend that low prices for discounted zone and higher prices for premium zone. But, if we discuss the selling trend, then you need to note that these are higher prices for discounted zone which seems against the rule, and these are lower prices in premium zone. How this is possible and what are the reasons behind this mechanism? Well, this is little piece of assignment for you. Find the reasons that why Forex chart is showing high price in discounted zone for sell trend. You can drop your answers in comment session or you can email me, or you can drop your assignment in telegram chat box as well. If you will not able to find the answer, we will discuss this in upcoming English webinar after 2 days. To join our weekly webinars for free, contact us on telegram.",
