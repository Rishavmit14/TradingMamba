The key visual characteristics of an order block include:\n\n1. **High and Low Price Levels**: The chart displays specific high and low price levels, which are marked with specific numbers.\n2. **Annotations and Markings**: There are annotations and markings, such as red arrows and lines, indicating specific price movements or trends.\n3. **Identification**: The term \"ORDER BLOCK\" is used to describe this specific area on the chart.\n\nThe trading application of an order block is to identify potential low-risk entry points with high reward potential. ICT recommends trading this pattern by identifying the high and low price levels, which can be used to set entry and exit points. The high price level represents the potential entry point, while the low price level represents the potential exit point. By trading within the order block, traders can take advantage of the large volume of trades executed by institutional traders, which can provide a stable and reliable entry point.",
