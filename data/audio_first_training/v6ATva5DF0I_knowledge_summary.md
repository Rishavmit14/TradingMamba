## FIBONACCI

*Teaching time: 0.3 min | Words: 48 | Frames: 2 | Generation time: 27.7s*

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting from 0 or 1. The sequence is often used in various fields, including finance, mathematics, and art, to represent growth and proportion. In the context of trading, the Fibonacci sequence can be used to identify potential trading opportunities based on price patterns. The "FIBONACCI" concept involves identifying Fibonacci levels, which are price levels that are 10 pips above the previous day's high. These levels can be used as entry points for trading, as they represent potential support or resistance levels. The Fibonacci sequence can also be used to identify Fibonacci retracement levels, which are price levels that are 10 pips below the previous day's high. These levels can be used as exit points for trades, as they represent potential resistance or profit targets.

## OPTIMAL TRADE ENTRY

*Teaching time: 1.3 min | Words: 185 | Frames: 5 | Generation time: 21.7s*

The "Optimal Trade Entry" concept, as taught by the Inner Circle Trader, involves identifying potential entry points for trades on a chart. The key visual characteristics of this pattern include high and low levels, candlestick patterns, support and resistance levels, and Bollinger Bands. The optimal trade entry is based on identifying when price is lower than the swing low, which is a low between the high and low. The chart analysis suggests that the market may be expanding on the upside, and the optimal trade entry is to use the swing low from here up to the high. The Inner Circle Trader recommends trading this pattern by identifying potential entry points and using them to enter trades.

- The "Stop Loss" and "Stop Loss Loss" annotations are used to set stop-loss orders.
- The "Entry" and "Entry Entry" annotations are used to set entry points for trades.
- The "1st Scaling at Old Range High" annotation is used to identify a specific price level for a potential entry or exit strategy.

**Trading Application**:
- ICT recommends trading the "ORDER BLOCK" pattern by setting a stop-loss order and a buy or sell order at specific price levels, known as "order blocks."
- The "62% level" is used as a reference point for setting the stop-loss order.
