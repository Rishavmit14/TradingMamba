## IMBALANCE

*Teaching time: 0.9 min | Words: 141 | Frames: 3 | Generation time: 34.6s*

The "IMBALANCE" concept in the context of trading refers to a situation where the price of a security or asset is not in line with its intrinsic value, typically due to market manipulation or other factors. The term "imbalance" refers to the discrepancy between the price of the asset and its intrinsic value, which can be due to various factors such as supply and demand, economic conditions, and other market forces.

To spot an imbalance on a chart, traders should look for patterns where the price of the asset is not aligned with its intrinsic value. Key visual characteristics to look for include:

1. **Price Imbalance**: The road labeled "Price Imbalance" intersects with the "Structure Mapping" road, indicating a potential imbalance in the price of the asset.
2. **Structure Mapping**: The road labeled "Structure Mapping" intersects with the "Price Delivery" road, suggesting that the structure of the market may not be accurately represented by the price data.
3. **Annotations and Markings**: The main road or highway is marked with a red circle, and the "Structure Mapping" road is marked with a red circle, indicating that these areas are important for identifying potential imbalances.
