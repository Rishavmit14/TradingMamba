This video shows the OTE pattern on the daily crude oil chart with entry at the 62% retracement level, emphasizing the 'bread-and-butter approach' to trading.\n\n## Rules\n1. **Commodity Application**: OTE works on crude oil and other commodities just like forex/indices\n2. **62% Tradesman Level**: The minimum entry requirement for OTE setups\n3. **Daily Chart Context**: Use daily chart OTE to frame lower timeframe entries\n4. **Candle High as Target**: The 'high on this candle' becomes the near-term objective\n5. **Previous Day Reference**: Entry near previous day's high or low provides context\n\n## Identification\n- On crude oil daily chart: Look for swing high to swing low, then retracement\n- The entry occurs around 25.90 at the 62% retracement level\n- Entry must be 'below the low' for shorts or specific zones for longs\n- The chart shows CRUDE OIL FUTURES (JUN 2020) on NYMEX\n- In this video: Demonstrates OTE entry on crude oil recovering after the 2020 crash",

Retail traders see these patterns and naturally assume reversal, but ICT prefers to see these patterns 'purged' - meaning price runs through them to collect liquidity before the real move.\n\n## Rules\n1. **Retail Trap**: Doji and pinbar patterns attract retail traders expecting reversal\n2. **Purge Mentality**: 'I'd like to see those purged. I like to see them run above that'\n3. **Liquidity Target**: These patterns create liquidity pools above/below their extremes\n4. **Counter-Trade Setup**: After purge, look for entries in the opposite direction\n5. **Sentiment Indicator**: 'There's a lot of sentiment built into the crude oil market based on this pseudo pinbar'\n\n## Identification\n- Look for doji or pinbar patterns on daily/4H charts\n- Retail traders will place stops beyond these patterns\n- Wait for price to sweep/purge through the pattern's high or low\n- The purge collects liquidity and sets up the real institutional move\n- In this video: 'This pattern here is pretty popular in the retail universe...
