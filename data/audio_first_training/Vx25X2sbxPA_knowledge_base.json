      "llm_summary": "ORDER BLOCK is a specific trading pattern identified on a chart, characterized by a high on a candle, typically near the end of a trading session, and a near-term objective. The high on this candle is marked by a specific price level, and the trader aims to achieve this objective. ORDER BLOCK is a bread-and-butter approach to trading, focusing on identifying and trading specific candle patterns, which are then used as entry and exit points. The trader should not invest money that they cannot afford to lose, and should not sustain a loss of some or all of their initial investment. ORDER BLOCK is a risk management strategy, as it involves taking a high level of risk, which may not be suitable for all investors.",

      "llm_summary": "The \"FIBONACCI\" concept refers to a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting from any number in the sequence. This concept is often used in financial trading as a tool to identify potential support and resistance levels. To spot Fibonacci patterns on a chart, traders should look for horizontal lines drawn at specific price levels, often used to identify potential support and resistance levels. The \"FIBONACCI\" concept is recommended for trading as it can provide valuable insights into market behavior and potential price movements. Key price levels to consider include the \"Previous Day's High\" and \"Previous Day's Low\". The \"FIBONACCI\" concept can be used to identify potential support and resistance levels, which traders can use to make informed trading decisions.",
