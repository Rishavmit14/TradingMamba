Premium zones are optimal for SELLING, not buying. Measured from swing low to swing high - area from 50% to 100% (top) is premium. Trading rule: avoid buying in premium during bullish trends.",

At equilibrium, price is neither expensive nor cheap, it's at fair value. Equilibrium acts as a pivot: above EQ = premium territory, below EQ = discount territory. Many traders use equilibrium as a decision point: if trending up and price pulls back to EQ, it's entering discount (buy zone). EQ is also called the 50% retracement or fair value line.",
