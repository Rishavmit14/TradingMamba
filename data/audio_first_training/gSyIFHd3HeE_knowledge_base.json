      "llm_summary": "### Premium and Discount Zones (PD Zones)\n\n#### Definition\nPremium and Discount Zones are price regions defined relative to a swing range that classify whether current price is overvalued (premium) or undervalued (discount). The concept originates from basic market economics: just as a buyer seeks to purchase goods below market price (discount) and a seller seeks to sell above market price (premium), institutional traders and fund managers apply the same principle when buying and selling currencies in the forex market. Premium means higher prices relative to the range, while discount means lower or cheaper prices relative to the range. PD zones are used as a confluence factor (not a standalone confirmation) to design high-probability trade setups.\n\n#### Identification\nPD zones are identified by dividing any swing range (from swing low to swing high, or swing high to swing low) into two halves using the 50% equilibrium level. The area above the 50% level in a bullish swing is the premium zone (overpriced area), and the area below 50% is the discount zone (underpriced area). For a bearish swing, the zones are inverted: above 50% is the discount zone and below 50% is the premium zone. The Fibonacci retracement tool or GAN box can be used to mark these zones, with key levels at 0%, 38%, 50%, 62%, 79%, and 100%. The 50% level is the critical dividing line known as the equilibrium point.\n\n#### Trading Application\nPD zones are used as a confluence factor in trade setup design. In a bullish trend, traders look to buy in the discount zone (below 50%) and recognize the premium zone (above 50%) as an area where buy setups are lower probability. In a bearish trend, traders look to sell in the discount zone (above 50% of the bearish swing) and recognize the premium zone as lower probability for sell setups. Setups designed in the discount zone are considered high probability, while setups in the premium zone are considered low probability. PD zones are most effective on higher time frames (Daily, H4, H1) and in swing trading contexts. They become less effective on lower time frames or for scalping, though they can still be used. PD zones are particularly useful in trend continuation scenarios during pullback/retracement phases.",

      "llm_summary": "### Equilibrium Level (50% of Range)\n\n#### Definition\nThe equilibrium level is the 50% retracement level of a given price swing (from swing high to swing low or vice versa). It represents the midpoint of the range and is described as the point of 'no premium no discount.' This level is the critical boundary that separates the premium zone from the discount zone within any swing range. It is derived directly from the Fibonacci retracement tool's 50% level.\n\n#### Identification\nThe equilibrium is identified by applying the Fibonacci retracement tool from the origin (starting point) of a price swing to its ending point. The 50% level that appears on the tool marks the equilibrium. On a chart, it is typically displayed as a bold horizontal line at the 50% Fibonacci level, with the premium zone on one side and the discount zone on the other. In a bullish swing, price above 50% is premium and below is discount. In a bearish swing, price above 50% is discount and below is premium.\n\n#### Trading Application\nThe equilibrium level serves as the primary decision boundary for trade direction filtering. Any trade setup designed on the discount side of equilibrium is classified as high probability. Any trade setup designed on the premium side of equilibrium is classified as low probability. Traders use this level to quickly assess whether a potential entry (such as an order block, fair value gap, or supply/demand zone) falls in a favorable zone. The equilibrium acts as a filter to improve risk-to-reward ratios by encouraging entries only on the discount side of the range.",

      "llm_summary": "### Fibonacci Retracement Tool for PD Zones\n\n#### Definition\nThe Fibonacci retracement tool is the primary analysis tool used to identify and mark premium and discount zones on a forex chart. It is applied to a completed price swing (either an expansion or a break of structure) to measure the magnitude of a subsequent retracement or pullback. The tool displays multiple horizontal levels (0%, 38%, 50%, 62%, 79%, 100%) across the swing range. The GAN box is mentioned as an alternative tool, but the Fibonacci retracement tool is presented as the most widely used method in forex markets.\n\n#### Identification\nFor a bullish swing, the Fibonacci tool is applied from the swing low (starting point/origin of price) to the swing high (ending point/stop point). For a bearish swing, the tool is applied from the swing high (starting point) to the swing low (ending point). Once applied, the tool automatically draws horizontal levels across the range. The 50% level divides the range into premium and discount halves. Key retracement levels displayed include 38% (shallow retracement), 50% (equilibrium), 62% (moderate depth into discount), and 79% (deep retracement into discount).\n\n#### Trading Application\nAfter a large move (expansion or break of structure), a retracement is expected as part of the natural price cycle. The Fibonacci tool measures this retracement to determine whether price has pulled back into the discount zone, making it favorable for trend continuation entries. Traders apply the tool, wait for price to retrace into the discount zone (below 50% for bullish, above 50% for bearish), and then look for additional confluence factors (order blocks, fair value gaps, demand/supply zones) within that discount zone before executing a trade. This process is designed to catch trend continuation moves at optimal entry prices.",

    "pd_zones_bullish_trend": {
      "llm_summary": "### PD Zones in Bullish Trend\n\n#### Definition\nIn a bullish (buying) trend, the premium zone is the upper portion of the swing range (above the 50% equilibrium level, closer to the swing high at 0%) and the discount zone is the lower portion (below 50%, closer to the swing low at 100%). The discount zone contains the lower, cheaper prices where institutional buyers prefer to enter. The premium zone contains the higher, more expensive prices where buy setups carry lower probability.\n\n#### Identification\nThe Fibonacci retracement tool is applied from the swing low (100% level) to the swing high (0% level). The area from 100% up to 50% is the discount zone, shaded or marked distinctly on the chart. The area from 50% up to 0% is the premium zone. On the schematic diagrams shown in the video, the discount zone is shaded in a light red/salmon color near the bottom, and the premium zone is shaded in green near the top, with the bold 50% line separating them. Key levels within the discount zone include 62% and 79% Fibonacci levels, which represent progressively deeper retracement depths.\n\n#### Trading Application\nIn a bullish trend, traders wait for price to retrace from the swing high back down into the discount zone (below 50%). Once price enters this zone, traders look for confluence with order blocks, fair value gaps, or demand zones within the discounted area. When price taps into one of these confluent zones, a buy trade can be executed for bullish trend continuation. The video demonstrates this with a real market example showing price moving from a swing low to a swing high, retracing into the discount zone, tapping into a demand zone/order block, and then resuming the bullish move. This process can be repeated on subsequent swing structures within the same trend.",

    "pd_zones_bearish_trend": {
      "llm_summary": "### PD Zones in Bearish Trend\n\n#### Definition\nIn a bearish (selling) trend, the zone labeling is inverted relative to the bullish trend. The discount zone is the upper portion of the swing range (above 50%, closer to the swing high at 100%) and the premium zone is the lower portion (below 50%, closer to the swing low at 0%). This inversion occurs because in a selling context, higher prices represent a discount (favorable entry for sellers) while lower prices represent premium (less favorable for new sell entries). This is the counterintuitive aspect of PD zones in bearish trends: the discount zone contains higher prices because sellers want to sell at the highest possible price.\n\n#### Identification\nThe Fibonacci retracement tool is applied from the swing high (100% level, the origin/starting point of the bearish move) to the swing low (0% level, the ending point). The area from 100% down to 50% is the discount zone for sellers (the upper half, containing higher prices). The area from 50% down to 0% is the premium zone (the lower half, containing lower prices). On the schematic diagrams, the discount zone in bearish trends is shaded in a light red/salmon color near the top, and the premium zone is shaded in green near the bottom. Key Fibonacci levels within the bearish discount zone include 62% and 79%.\n\n#### Trading Application\nIn a bearish trend, traders wait for price to retrace from the swing low back up into the discount zone (above 50%). Once price enters this zone, traders look for confluence with order blocks, price imbalances, or supply zones within the discounted area. When price taps into one of these confluent zones, a sell trade can be executed for bearish trend continuation. The video demonstrates this with a real market example showing price moving from a swing high to a swing low, retracing up into the discount zone, tapping into a supply zone and price imbalance, and then falling heavily to continue the bearish move. The instructor poses the question of why higher prices appear in the discount zone for sell trends as a learning exercise, highlighting the conceptual challenge of this inversion.",

      "llm_summary": "### PD Zone Confluence with Order Blocks and Fair Value Gaps\n\n#### Definition\nPD zone confluence refers to the practice of combining premium and discount zone analysis with other ICT price action concepts such as order blocks, fair value gaps (FVG), imbalances, and supply/demand zones. PD zones are explicitly described as a confluence factor, not a standalone confirmation signal. The core principle is that any order block, fair value gap, or supply/demand zone located within the discount zone of a swing is a high-probability setup, while the same patterns located within the premium zone are low-probability setups.\n\n#### Identification\nAfter applying the Fibonacci retracement tool to identify the discount and premium zones, the trader examines whether key ICT structures (order blocks, fair value gaps, imbalances, demand zones for buys, supply zones for sells) fall within the discount zone. The confluence is confirmed when a recognized price action pattern aligns spatially with the discount zone. For bullish setups, this means an order block or demand zone exists below the 50% level. For bearish setups, this means an order block, supply zone, or imbalance exists above the 50% level.\n\n#### Trading Application\nThe trading process follows a specific sequence: (1) identify the trend direction, (2) apply the Fibonacci retracement tool to the most recent swing, (3) identify the discount zone, (4) wait for price to retrace into the discount zone, (5) look for an order block, fair value gap, or demand/supply zone within that discount area, (6) execute the trade when price taps into that confluent zone. The video's key summary rule states: every order block, fair value gap, or supply/demand zone in the discount zone is high probability, while the same in the premium zone is low probability. This filtering mechanism helps traders avoid low-probability entries and improve their risk-to-reward ratio.",
