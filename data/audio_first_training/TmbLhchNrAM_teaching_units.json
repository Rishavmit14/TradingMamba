    "text": "the Fib, if it gets to that price level and runs a specific price point for liquidity, which is the Friday's high, which is we annotated on the daily chart, the market will likely rather want to gravitate towards that old Friday high because the trend is bullish. It's going to want to take liquidity out there because a lot of people are short selling in the S&P. The market has taken up above Friday's high and to the Fib level 2936, the high comes in on this candle at 2937, only off by one handle on the S&P and it went up again to another opportunity to do so. And again, 2937, so it was only off by one handle, but you could take this idea here and instead of reaching for the 2936 round down to the nearest five level.",
