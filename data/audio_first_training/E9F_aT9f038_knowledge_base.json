      "llm_summary": "**DISPLACEMENT** is a trading strategy that involves identifying and exploiting price movements that occur when a significant amount of orders are placed at the same price level. The strategy is based on the idea that when a large number of orders are placed at a specific price level, the price may move in a direction opposite to the direction of the majority of the orders, creating a \"displacement\" effect.\n\n**Identification**:\n- **Key Visual Characteristics**: The displacement pattern is characterized by a sudden increase in the number of orders at a specific price level, followed by a price movement in the opposite direction. This can be observed on a chart by looking for a significant increase in the number of orders at a specific price level, followed by a price move in the opposite direction.\n- **Timeframe and Trading Pair**: The displacement pattern is typically seen in a 5-minute timeframe, and the trading pair is usually the Australian Dollar (AUD) against the US Dollar (USD).\n\n**Trading Application**:\n- **Key Price Levels**: The displacement pattern is most effective when the price moves in the opposite direction to the majority of the orders. The displacement level is the price level where the majority of the orders are placed, and the displacement price is the price level where the majority of the orders are removed.\n- **Risk Management**: The displacement pattern can be used to manage risk by identifying the displacement level and the displacement price. The displacement level can be used as a stop-loss order, and the displacement price can be used as a take-profit order.\n- **Risk Assessment**: The displacement pattern can be used to assess the risk associated with the trade. The displacement level can be used as a risk-reducing level, and the displacement price can be used as a risk-reward level.\n\n**Key Price Levels**:\n- **Displacement Level**: The displacement level is the price level where the majority of the orders are placed.\n- **Displacement Price**: The displacement price is the price level where the majority of the orders are removed.\n\n**Risk Disclosure**:\n- **The National Futures Association (NFA) and CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission)**: The displacement pattern can be used to manage risk by identifying the displacement level and the displacement price. The displacement level can be used as a stop-loss order, and the displacement price can be used as a take-profit order.
