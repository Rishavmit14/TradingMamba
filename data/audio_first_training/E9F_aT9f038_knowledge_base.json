      "llm_summary": "## Definition\nThe Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) is ICT's signature Fibonacci-based entry model that identifies the sweet spot between the 62% and 79% retracement levels of a price swing. This zone represents where institutional order flow supports trade continuation with minimal drawdown and maximum reward potential.\n\n## Rules\n1. **Identify valid swing**: Locate a clear swing low to swing high (bullish) or swing high to swing low (bearish)\n2. **Apply Fibonacci**: Draw retracement from swing low (100%) to swing high (0%) for bullish setups\n3. **OTE Zone**: Entry zone lies between 62% (0.618) and 79% (0.79) retracement\n4. **Sweet Spot**: The 70.5% level is considered the optimal entry within the zone\n5. **Confirmation**: Wait for price to enter zone and show rejection before entry\n6. **Time alignment**: Trade during New York session (8:30-11:00 AM EST) for highest probability\n7. **Bias requirement**: OTE must align with higher timeframe directional bias\n\n## Identification\n- ICT demonstrates on AUD/USD pair throughout this long-form tutorial\n- Multiple examples show OTE entries at 62% and 70.5% levels\n- Look for displacement move, then retracement into OTE zone\n- Entry candles show rejection wicks into the zone with bodies closing outside\n- Price respects the zone and continues in the direction of the original displacement\n\n## Trading Application\n- Entry: Limit order at 62% for aggressive entry, 70.5% for optimal, market order on confirmation\n- Stop Loss: Below swing low (100% level) for longs, above swing high for shorts\n- Take Profit: Use Fibonacci extensions at -0.5, -1.0, -1.5, -2.0 levels\n- Risk Management: Maximum 1-2% account risk per trade\n- Expected R:R: Minimum 3:1, optimal setups yield 4:1 or better\n- Scale out: 50% at first target, 30% at second, 20% runner",
