## Concepts Extracted

### 1. Premium and Discount Zones (PD Zones)

**Definition:** Premium and Discount Zones are price regions defined relative to a swing range that classify whether current price is overvalued (premium) or undervalued (discount). The concept originates from basic market economics: just as a buyer seeks to purchase goods below market price (discount) and a seller seeks to sell above market price (premium), institutional traders and fund managers apply the same principle when buying and selling currencies in the forex market. PD zones are used as a confluence factor (not a standalone confirmation) to design high-probability trade setups.

**Identification:** PD zones are identified by dividing any swing range into two halves using the 50% equilibrium level. The area above 50% in a bullish swing is the premium zone (overpriced), and below 50% is the discount zone (underpriced). For a bearish swing, the zones invert: above 50% is discount and below 50% is premium. The Fibonacci retracement tool or GAN box can be used to mark these zones, with key levels at 0%, 38%, 50%, 62%, 79%, and 100%.

**Trading Application:** In a bullish trend, buy in the discount zone (below 50%) for high-probability setups. In a bearish trend, sell in the discount zone (above 50% of the bearish swing). Setups in the discount zone are high probability; setups in the premium zone are low probability. PD zones are most effective on higher time frames (Daily, H4, H1) and swing trading. They become less effective on lower time frames or scalping. PD zones are especially useful during pullback/retracement phases in trend continuation scenarios.

### 2. Equilibrium Level (50% of Range)

**Definition:** The equilibrium level is the 50% retracement level of a given price swing, representing the midpoint of the range. It is described as the point of "no premium no discount." This level is the critical boundary that separates premium from discount within any swing range, derived directly from the Fibonacci retracement tool's 50% level.

**Identification:** The equilibrium is marked by the bold 50% line when the Fibonacci retracement tool is applied from the origin of a price swing to its ending point. In a bullish swing, price above 50% is premium and below is discount. In a bearish swing, price above 50% is discount and below is premium.

**Trading Application:** The equilibrium serves as the primary decision boundary for trade direction filtering. Any setup on the discount side is high probability; any setup on the premium side is low probability. Traders use this level to quickly assess whether a potential entry falls in a favorable zone, acting as a filter to improve risk-to-reward ratios.

### 3. Fibonacci Retracement Tool for PD Zones

**Definition:** The Fibonacci retracement tool is the primary analysis tool used to identify and mark premium and discount zones on a forex chart. It is applied to a completed price swing (expansion or break of structure) to measure the magnitude of a subsequent retracement or pullback. The tool displays multiple horizontal levels (0%, 38%, 50%, 62%, 79%, 100%). The GAN box is an alternative tool, but Fibonacci is the most widely used.

**Identification:** For a bullish swing, apply from swing low (starting point) to swing high (ending point). For a bearish swing, apply from swing high (starting point) to swing low (ending point). The 50% level divides the range into premium and discount halves. Key levels: 38% (shallow retracement), 50% (equilibrium), 62% (moderate depth), 79% (deep retracement).

**Trading Application:** After a large move, a retracement is expected as part of the natural price cycle. The Fibonacci tool measures this retracement to determine whether price has pulled back into the discount zone. Traders apply the tool, wait for price to retrace into the discount zone, then look for additional confluence factors (order blocks, fair value gaps, demand/supply zones) within the discount zone before executing trend continuation entries.

### 4. PD Zones in Bullish Trend

**Definition:** In a bullish trend, the premium zone is the upper portion of the swing range (above 50%, closer to swing high at 0%) and the discount zone is the lower portion (below 50%, closer to swing low at 100%). The discount zone contains lower, cheaper prices where institutional buyers prefer to enter.

**Identification:** Fibonacci applied from swing low (100%) to swing high (0%). The area from 100% up to 50% is the discount zone. From 50% up to 0% is the premium zone. In the video schematics, the discount zone is shaded in light red/salmon near the bottom, premium zone in green near the top, with a bold 50% line separating them. Key discount levels: 62% and 79%.

**Trading Application:** Traders wait for price to retrace from the swing high back into the discount zone (below 50%), then look for confluence with order blocks, fair value gaps, or demand zones. When price taps into a confluent discount zone, execute a buy trade for trend continuation. The video shows real market examples where price retraces into the discount zone, taps an order block/demand zone, and resumes the bullish move. This process repeats on subsequent swing structures.

### 5. PD Zones in Bearish Trend

**Definition:** In a bearish trend, the zone labeling inverts. The discount zone is the upper portion (above 50%, closer to swing high at 100%) and the premium zone is the lower portion (below 50%, closer to swing low at 0%). Higher prices represent a discount for sellers (favorable entry) while lower prices represent premium (less favorable). This is the counterintuitive aspect: the discount zone contains higher prices because sellers want to sell at the highest possible price.

**Identification:** Fibonacci applied from swing high (100%, origin of bearish move) to swing low (0%, ending point). The area from 100% down to 50% is the discount zone for sellers (upper half, higher prices). From 50% to 0% is the premium zone (lower half, lower prices). The discount zone in bearish trends is shaded in light red/salmon near the top in the video schematics.

**Trading Application:** Traders wait for price to retrace from the swing low back up into the discount zone (above 50%), then look for confluence with order blocks, price imbalances, or supply zones. When price taps into a confluent discount zone, execute a sell trade for bearish continuation. The video shows a real market example where price retraces into the discount zone, taps a supply zone and price imbalance, then falls heavily. The instructor highlights this inversion as a conceptual challenge and assigns it as a learning exercise.

### 6. PD Zone Confluence with Order Blocks and Fair Value Gaps

**Definition:** PD zone confluence combines premium/discount zone analysis with other ICT concepts: order blocks, fair value gaps (FVG), imbalances, and supply/demand zones. PD zones are explicitly a confluence factor, not a standalone confirmation. The core rule: any order block, FVG, or supply/demand zone in the discount zone is high probability; the same patterns in the premium zone are low probability.

**Identification:** After applying the Fibonacci tool to identify discount and premium zones, examine whether key ICT structures fall within the discount zone. Confluence is confirmed when a recognized price action pattern aligns spatially with the discount zone. For bullish setups: order block or demand zone below 50%. For bearish setups: order block, supply zone, or imbalance above 50%.

**Trading Application:** The process follows a sequence: (1) identify trend direction, (2) apply Fibonacci to the most recent swing, (3) identify the discount zone, (4) wait for price to retrace into it, (5) look for an order block, FVG, or supply/demand zone within the discount area, (6) execute when price taps into that confluent zone. The video's key summary rule: every OB/FVG/SD zone in discount = high probability; every OB/FVG/SD zone in premium = low probability. This filter improves risk-to-reward ratios.

## Key Takeaways

1. **PD zones divide any swing range at the 50% equilibrium level** into premium (overpriced) and discount (underpriced) halves.
2. **Always trade in the discount zone** for high-probability setups; avoid premium zone entries as they are lower probability.
3. **Bullish trend:** discount is below 50% (lower prices); **Bearish trend:** discount is above 50% (higher prices, counterintuitive).
4. **Use Fibonacci retracement tool** from swing origin to swing end to mark these zones with levels at 0%, 38%, 50%, 62%, 79%, 100%.
5. **PD zones are confluence, not confirmation** -- combine with order blocks, fair value gaps, and supply/demand zones.
6. **Most effective on higher time frames** (D1, H4, H1) and swing trading; less effective for scalping on lower time frames.
7. **Institutional principle:** big institutions, hedgers, and fund managers always buy at discount and sell at premium.
8. **Trend continuation strategy:** apply Fibonacci after expansion, wait for retracement into discount zone, enter on confluence with ICT structures.
