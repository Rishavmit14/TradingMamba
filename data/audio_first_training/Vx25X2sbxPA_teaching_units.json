And if you look at this candle, which is yesterday's daily range, is it more likely to break below and trade lower or trade higher? My argument would be it would likely run this candle's high. Not just this candle's high, but this candle's high because there's a lot of sentiment built into the crude oil market based on this pseudo pinbar or doji or whatever they want to classify it. Steve Nielsen's patterns, I'm not here to try to kick dirt in his face, but there just simply isn't enough to warrant a financial decision based on some willy-nilly pattern in a candlestick formation.",
