## FAIR VALUE GAP

*Teaching time: 4.0 min | Words: 592 | Frames: 9 | Generation time: 65.1s*

The "FAIR VALUE GAP" concept, as taught by the Inner Circle Trader (ICT), involves identifying and trading in fair value gap zones. These zones are identified by specific chart patterns, such as bearish patterns, bearishish patterns, and bearishishish patterns, which create price imbalances or fair value gaps. The key visual characteristics of these patterns include:

1. **Bearish Patterns**: These patterns show a bearish trend in the price of the asset.
2. **Bearishish Patterns**: These patterns show additional bearishness in the bearish patterns.
3. **Bearishishish Patterns**: These patterns show additional bearishness and additional bearishness.
4. **Bearishishishish Patterns**: These patterns show additional bearishness, additional bearishness, and additional bearishness.

The ICT recommends trading in these fair value gap zones, as they represent potential profit opportunities. The key price levels to consider are:

1. **Previous Low**: The price candle must create a price imbalance or fair value gap zone, which is a downward trend in the price of the asset.
2. **Fair Value Gap Zone**: The price candle must create a price imbalance or fair value gap zone, which represents potential profit opportunities.

The trading application involves identifying fair value gap zones on a chart, creating a price imbalance or fair value gap zone, and then trading in the asset. The key limitation is that the fair value gap zones may not be tapped into by the market, as there may be another level prior to these levels, which is actually flow and moved into trend direction.
