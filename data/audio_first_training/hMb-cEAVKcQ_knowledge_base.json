The term \"FAIR VALUE GAP\" is used to describe a gap between the fair value of a trade and the actual price at which the trade is executed, which can lead to a loss if the trade is executed at a price lower than the fair value gap.\n\nThe concept of FAIR VALUE GAP is important in trading because it can indicate a potential risk of loss if the trade is executed at a price lower than the fair value gap. Traders who are aware of FAIR VALUE GAP can use it as a trading strategy to enter trades at a price higher than the fair value gap, which can increase the likelihood of a profit if the trade is executed at a price higher than the fair value gap.\n\nThe term \"FAIR VALUE GAP\" is used to describe a gap between the fair value of a trade and the actual price at which the trade is executed, which can lead to a loss if the trade is executed at a price lower than the fair value gap.

These levels are drawn from the highest candle wick, and they are considered fair value gaps.\n\n2. **Chart Patterns and Price Levels**: The chart shows a range or consolidation phase, with specific price levels mentioned or visible. These levels are crucial for identifying the optimal entry point for trading.\n\n3. **Trading Application**: The ICT recommends trading in these fair value gaps. The focus is on identifying the highest candle wick, which represents the fair value gap. Once identified, the optimal entry point is to buy or sell, depending on the direction of the price movement.\n\n4. **Key Price Levels**: The top price level, bottom price level, and middle price level are important.
