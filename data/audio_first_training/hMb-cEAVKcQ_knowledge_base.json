      "llm_summary": "Fair Value Gap (FVG) is a 3-candle price imbalance where middle candle's wick does NOT overlap with candles on either side, creating a 'gap' or inefficiency. This represents an area where price moved so fast that normal buying/selling didn't occur - an imbalance. FVG appears when strong momentum causes price to skip levels. Smart Money typically returns to fill these gaps (rebalance). FVGs act as support/resistance and optimal entry zones. Bullish FVG = gap below current price (support). Bearish FVG = gap above current price (resistance).",
