      "llm_summary": "### Higher High in ICT Trading\n\n#### Definition\nA higher high is a price point where the market closes above the previous high, indicating a new high in the price action. This pattern is typically seen in bullish market conditions, where the market is moving higher and creating new highs.\n\n#### Identification\nTo spot a higher high, look for a price point where the market closes above the previous high. This can be identified by observing the chart and identifying the highest price point that is followed by a close above the previous high. The key visual characteristics include:\n- A price point where the market closes above the previous high.\n- The market is in a bullish trend.\n- The market is creating new highs.\n- The market is not in a bearish trend.\n\n#### Trading Application\nIn a bullish trend, higher highs are considered valid higher highs. They indicate a new high in the price action, which is a positive sign for traders. Higher lows, on the other hand, are considered valid higher lows, indicating a new low in the price action, which is also a positive sign for traders.\n\n#### Key Price Levels\nThe higher highs and lower lows are important price levels in trading. They can be used to identify potential support and resistance levels, which can be used to make trading decisions. The higher highs and lower lows can also be used to identify potential buy and sell signals, which can be used to enter or exit trades.\n\n#### Conclusion\nHigher highs and lower lows are critical price patterns in trading, and they can be used to identify potential support and resistance levels, as well as potential buy and sell signals. Traders should monitor these patterns closely and use them as tools to make informed trading decisions.",
