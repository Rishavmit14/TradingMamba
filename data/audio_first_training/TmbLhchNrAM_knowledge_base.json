      "llm_summary": "## Definition\nThe Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) is a universal pattern that works across all markets including forex, futures, commodities, and indices. This video demonstrates OTE on the S&P 500 E-mini futures (June 2020 contract), proving the pattern is not limited to forex. The OTE zone remains the 62%-79% Fibonacci retracement level.\n\n## Rules\n1. **Market Agnostic**: OTE works on any liquid market - forex, futures, indices, commodities\n2. **Timeframe Scalable**: The pattern can be applied to any timeframe from 1-minute to daily charts\n3. **Daily Context**: Frame trades within the larger daily optimal trade entry zone for higher probability\n4. **79% Level Significance**: Price falling short of the 79% retracement level is common and still valid\n5. **Liquidity Focus**: The real edge is targeting liquidity, not just hitting Fibonacci levels\n\n## Identification\n- On S&P E-mini: Identify swing low to swing high, apply Fibonacci\n- Price retraced to near the 79% level (just fell short) which is still valid\n- Look for swing low, swing high, and retracement pattern forming\n- The daily chart shows price in a 'larger daily optimal trade entry' zone\n- Entry occurs when lower timeframe aligns with daily OTE context",

A swing high is a high with lower highs on both sides; a swing low is a low with higher lows on both sides. These points define the price legs used for OTE analysis.\n\n## Rules\n1. **Swing High Definition**: A candle high with at least one lower high on each side\n2. **Swing Low Definition**: A candle low with at least one higher low on each side\n3. **Leg Structure**: Price moves from swing low to swing high (or vice versa) form tradeable legs\n4. **Retracement Anchor**: Always draw Fibonacci from swing low to swing high for bullish setups\n5. **Market Structure**: Breaking swing highs/lows indicates trend continuation or reversal\n\n## Identification\n- On the chart: 'We have a swing low, swing high and a retracement here'\n- The swing low forms the origin point for Fibonacci measurement\n- The swing high marks the terminus before retracement begins\n- After retracement, price moving beyond the swing high confirms the bullish structure\n- In this video: Clear swing low around 2717, swing high around 2965 on S&P E-mini",

The 'magic is not the fib, it's the target of liquidity.' Fibonacci levels work because they often coincide with areas where retail traders place stops, creating liquidity pools.\n\n## Rules\n1. **Liquidity Over Fib**: Fibonacci is a framework; liquidity targeting is the real edge\n2. **Buy-Side Liquidity**: Resting above swing highs (retail sell stops, breakout buy orders)\n3. **Sell-Side Liquidity**: Resting below swing lows (retail buy stops, breakout sell orders)\n4. **Previous Day High/Low**: Key liquidity pools that price gravitates toward\n5. **Context Framework**: 'The fib just helps me frame an underlying context'\n\n## Identification\n- Identify where retail traders would logically place stop losses\n- Previous day's highs and lows are primary liquidity targets\n- 'We want to look for a signature in price that would lend well to aiming for our previous days high or low'\n- Equal highs/lows represent concentrated liquidity pools\n- In this video: Focus on targeting previous day's high or low as the liquidity objective",

The framework shows how these levels create an entry zone where institutional accumulation occurs.\n\n## Rules\n1. **Key Levels**: 62%, 70.5%, and 79% form the optimal entry zone\n2. **Level Labels**: Chart shows specific price levels at each Fibonacci percentage\n3. **Falling Short Valid**: Price just 'fell short of hitting the 79% tradesman level' - still valid entry\n4. **Framework Purpose**: 'It just gives you a framework' - not absolute targets\n5. **Daily Anchor**: Use daily chart Fibonacci to frame intraday entries\n\n## Identification\n- On S&P chart: 0.62 at 2811.50, 0.705 at 2795.25, 0.79 at 2779.25\n- Swing from 2717.25 (1.0 level) to 2965.00 (0 level)\n- The retracement zone is shaded showing the OTE area\n- Price reaction within this zone validates the setup\n- In this video: Price retraced into the zone and held, confirming bullish bias",
