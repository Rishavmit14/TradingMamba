      "llm_summary": "## Definition\nThe Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) is a precision entry technique using Fibonacci retracement levels (62%-79%) to enter trades at the most favorable price within a swing. This video demonstrates OTE on Mexican Peso Futures (6M).\n\n## Rules\n1. **Identify displacement**: Look for a strong impulsive move that breaks market structure\n2. **Wait for retracement**: After displacement, price must retrace to the OTE zone (62%-79%)\n3. **Confluence required**: OTE should align with order blocks, fair value gaps, or liquidity levels\n4. **Thursday setup**: This video shows a Thursday setup after Wednesday's daily high was established\n5. **Time element**: Trade during New York session for best results\n\n## Identification\n- Mexican Peso Futures (6M) on 5-minute chart\n- Swing low at 0.04324 (100% level)\n- Swing high at 0.04353 (0% level)\n- OTE zone: 62% at 0.04335, 70.5% at 0.04333, 79% at 0.04330\n- Entry taken at 70.5% level after candle rejection\n- Thursday Daily High marked as draw on liquidity\n\n## Trading Application\n- Entry: 70.5% Fibonacci level at 0.04333\n- Stop Loss: Below 79% level at 0.04324 (approximately)\n- Target 1: 50% retracement at 0.04368\n- Target 2: -1.0 extension at 0.04382 (Thursday Daily High)\n- Target 3: -1.5 extension at 0.04397\n- Demonstrated reward-to-risk ratio exceeds 4:1",
