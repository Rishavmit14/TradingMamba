If you come into this industry or if you've been unable to find profitability and you can't warm up to this idea, I guarantee you if you try it, you'll love it. Because it manages all of that fear and greed that tug of war that takes place once you put the trade on in a live setting. You want to get out of the trade. You want it to get to your target right away, but you can't force that. But as it logically moves to levels where you could take partial profits and exit some of the position, thus reducing the exposure or risk, but rewarding and adding to your bottom line because these targets are not guaranteed. But guess what? If you're in a market and it's trading here and you put your market order to get out, that's more likely to fill you in a profit than waiting for that undelivered target.",
