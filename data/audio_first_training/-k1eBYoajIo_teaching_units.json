And the stop would be below 138951, just using a standard 15 pip. It's a little bit wider spread for this pair. 20 pips comes in at 1.5 of standard deviation, 30 pips at 1 standard deviation, 40 pips at 1.5 standard deviations, and finally, as I talked with this model, if it ever goes to 2 standard deviations, you want to take your profits there. Yes, it went a little bit beyond that, but again, we're not trying to split hairs. We want something that delivers very consistent, rule-based, we're not trying to be absolutely perfect with our entry, not absolutely perfect with our exit. We don't need that.",
