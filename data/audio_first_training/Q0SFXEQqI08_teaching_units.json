But before I get into it, I want you to take a look at this chart and I want you to think about what the neophyte or the new trader that's just being exposed to what I teach or someone that thinks they've been around the block a few times and they think it's just something being renamed, rehashed, reinvented to try to take credit from some old guy that's paired in a long since been forgotten.
