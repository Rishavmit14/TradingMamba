ICT is focusing on specific moments where the public or retail traders' mindset or opinion about a marketplace is so obvious based on what's true. This could involve identifying specific price levels or patterns that are commonly recognized by traders.\n\n2. **Order Block**: The term \"order block\" refers to a specific type of order that specifies the quantity and price of a trade. In the context of trading, an order block can be used to specify a specific number of shares to buy or sell at a specific price. ICT is likely referring to the logic behind deciphering price action, which involves identifying these specific order blocks.\n\n3. **Public or Retail Traders**: The term \"public or retail traders\" refers to individuals who are not professionals or institutions, but rather individuals who are trading on their own or in small groups. These traders often have different opinions and biases, which can influence their trading decisions. ICT is likely discussing how these public or retail traders' opinions can influence price action.\n\n4. **Resistance and Support**: Resistance and support are technical indicators used in technical analysis to identify key levels where price action is likely to stop or reverse. ICT is likely discussing how these levels can be used to identify potential entry or exit points for traders.\n\n5. **Timeframe and Trading Pair**: The timeframe shown on the chart is 1 Day (1D), and the trading pair is NYMEX. This indicates that the chart is showing daily price action for a specific commodity or financial instrument on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).\n\nIn summary, the chart shows specific price action patterns, including order blocks, public or retail traders' opinions, and technical indicators such as resistance and support levels. The timeframe and trading pair provide context for the specific chart patterns being discussed.",
