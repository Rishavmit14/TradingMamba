Incomplete auction means, there will be pending orders and those pending orders create liquidity. There are pending orders to be filled within the price imbalance or void. That why price imbalance is also known as liquidity void, because this is area of liquidity for buyers and sellers to transact and complete their orders. As market need liquidity for its next move, on this basis when market comes into the imbalance zone or liquidity void zone, then on the base of this liquidity void, we can design our sell or buy model.
