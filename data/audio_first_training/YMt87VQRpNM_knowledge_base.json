This video shows a short trade setup on the September 2020 T-Bond contract (ZBU2020) with precise entry at the 62% retracement level, targeting relative equal lows as the liquidity pool.\n\n## Rules\n1. **Fixed Income Application**: OTE works on Treasury Bonds just like forex, equities, and commodities\n2. **Daily to Intraday Flow**: Start with daily chart analysis, then drop to 5-minute for entry precision\n3. **Turning Points**: Identify 'turning point' highs and lows that define the swing structure\n4. **Retracement Within OTE**: Price must 'have a retracement within optimal trade entry' zone\n5. **Bearish OTE**: For shorts, draw Fibonacci from swing high to swing low, enter on retracement up\n\n## Identification\n- On T-Bond daily chart: 'High to this low and we had a retracement in here'\n- Entry at 177'20 on the 5-minute chart within the OTE zone (0.62-0.79 levels)\n- The chart shows T-BOND FUTURES (SEP 2020) on CBOT exchange\n- 5-minute chart used for precise entry timing within the daily OTE context\n- In this video: Short entry targeting relative equal lows for 29 ticks ($906.25 profit)",
