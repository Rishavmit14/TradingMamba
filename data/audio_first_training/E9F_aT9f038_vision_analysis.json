The MACD line is a moving average of the difference between two moving averages, and it is used to identify overbought and oversold conditions.\n\n6. **Moving Average Crossover (MACD)**: ICT mentions the MACD crossover, which is a technical indicator used to identify when the MACD line crosses above or below the zero line. This crossover can indicate a change in trend or a potential turning point.\n\n7. **Moving Average Oscillator (MACO)**: ICT references the MACO oscillator, which is a momentum oscillator. The MACO oscillator is used to identify overbought and oversold conditions and is often used in conjunction with other indicators to enhance trading signals.\n\n8. **Moving Average Stochastic (MOS)**: ICT mentions the MOS oscillator, which is a momentum oscillator. The MOS oscillator is used to identify overbought and oversold conditions and is often used in conjunction with other indicators to enhance trading signals.\n\n9. **Moving Average Weighted Average (MAW)**: ICT references the MAW, which is a moving average that gives more weight to recent prices. The MAW is used to identify overbought and oversold conditions and is often used in conjunction with other indicators to enhance trading signals.\n\n10. **Moving Average Exponential Weighted Average (MAEWA)**: ICT mentions the MAEWA, which is a moving average that gives more weight to recent prices. The MAEWA is used to identify overbought and oversold conditions and is often used in conjunction with other indicators to enhance trading signals.\n\nThe visual supports for these concepts include:\n- **Moving Averages**: The horizontal lines drawn at specific price levels.\n- **Key Levels**: The highlighted \"Previous Day's High\" and \"Previous Day's Low\" levels.\n- **Bollinger Bands**: The horizontal lines drawn at specific price levels.\n- **Moving Channels**: The horizontal lines drawn at specific price levels.\n- **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**: The MACD line, which is a moving average of the difference between two moving averages.\n- **Moving Average Oscillator (MACO)**: The MACO oscillator, which is a momentum oscillator.\n- **Moving Average Stochastic (MOS)**: The MOS oscillator, which is a momentum oscillator.\n- **Moving Average Weighted Average (MAW)**: The MAW, which is a moving average that gives more weight to recent prices.\n- **Moving Average Exponential Weighted Average (MAEWA)**: The MAEWA, which is a moving average that gives more weight to recent prices.",

The chart also features a moving average, which is a moving average line that helps to smooth out the price action and identify the trend direction.\n   - The chart includes a Fibonacci retracement level, which is a retracement level based on the Fibonacci sequence, which is a series of numbers in which each number is the ratio of the previous two numbers.\n   - The chart shows a consolidation pattern, which is a pattern where the price action is not moving in a clear direction, and the price is moving within a narrow range.\n   - The chart includes a trend line reversal, which is a reversal of a trend line, indicating a change in the direction of the trend.\n\n2. **Price Levels**:\n   - The chart shows specific price levels, such as the projected level, which is a projected price level based on the current price and the trend line.\n   - The chart includes price levels such as the high and low, which are the highest and lowest prices in the chart.\n   -
