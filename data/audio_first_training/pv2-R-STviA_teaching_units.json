So if we know that that's where liquidity rests, all we have to do is discern whether or not does the market want to seek the buyers or does it want to seek the sellers? And the way you get that indication is by studying when they go into consolidation, which side of the market they're reaching for, and then where's the market going after it happens. And here you can clearly see every time there's a consolidation, the market seeks the liquidity below the marketplace. And once it absorbs it, it quickly runs the other direction. Why is that happening?",
