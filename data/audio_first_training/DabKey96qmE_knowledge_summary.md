## Overview

This video teaches the foundational concept of **Market Structure Mapping** using Smart Money Concepts (SMC). The instructor emphasizes that 50% of forex trading success depends on correctly mapping market structure.

## Key Concepts Learned

### 1. Market Structure (Critical)

Market structure is the systematic identification of trend direction through swing highs and lows.

- **Bullish Trend:** Higher Highs (HH) + Higher Lows (HL)
- **Bearish Trend:** Lower Lows (LL) + Lower Highs (LH)

**Key Insight:** Market trend is also known as market structure. Understanding it correctly gives you 50% of your trading edge.

---

### 2. Higher High (HH) - SMC Definition

A valid Higher High in Smart Money Concepts is NOT just any high above the previous high.

**Validation Rules:**
1. Market must take out the **inducement** (first pullback on left side of current high)
2. Candle body must **close above** the previous high
3. If only the wick breaks above (body closes below) = **Liquidity Sweep**, NOT a valid HH

---

### 3. Inducement / Smart Money Trap (Critical)

The most important concept in this video. Inducement is:
- The **first pullback** on the left side of the current high
- A **liquidity pool** where retail traders place stop losses
- Must be **taken out** before a swing is valid

**Visual Identification:**
- Look left of any high
- Find the first minor swing low (pullback)
- That's your inducement level

---

### 4. Liquidity Sweep

When price wicks above a high but the candle body does NOT close above it.

**What it means:**
- Smart Money is hunting stop losses
- NOT a genuine breakout
- Expect reversal, not continuation

**Detection:** Wick above high + body closes below = Liquidity Sweep

---

### 5. Retail vs Smart Money Approach

| Aspect | Retail Traders | Smart Money Traders |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| HH Rule | Any high > previous high | Must take out inducement + body close above |
| Result | Get trapped at false breakouts | Filter invalid setups |
| Mindset | "It's manipulation!" | "It's predictable behavior" |

---

## Two Critical Rules for Valid Structure

### Rule 1: Inducement Must Be Taken
> Higher High will be confirmed when market **must take out the first (recent) inducement** from previous swing.

### Rule 2: Candle Body Close Rule
> Candle body **must close below inducement AND above recent high**. Otherwise, mark as liquidity sweep.

## Trading Application

1. **Before any trade:** Correctly identify market structure
2. **For longs:** Wait for valid HH (inducement taken + body close above)
3. **Entry zone:** Look for opportunities at Higher Lows
4. **Filter signals:** If inducement not taken, the swing is not valid - skip it
5. **Avoid traps:** When you see liquidity sweep (wick only), expect reversal
